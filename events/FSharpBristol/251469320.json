You won't need anything installed (except perhaps a web browser). This hands on workshop is an hour long introduction to FSharp, Notebooks and Random Forests as we walk through the titanic dataset to predict who will live and who will suffer a horrible submarine death. Will you sink or will you swim at this -hopefully quite straight forward- challenge?</p> ",
