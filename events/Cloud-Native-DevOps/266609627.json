You\u2019ve built your website, and now you just need to deploy it. There are various ways that this could be done - from (S)FTP, to SCP and rsync, to running commands like git pull and composer install directly on the server which is not ideal. I've been using Ansible and Ansistrano to deploy a variety of PHP projects - including Drupal 7 &amp; 8, Symfony, Laravel and Sculpin, as well as basic HTML websites, and found it to be very flexible and easy to install and use, and by the end of this talk we will have a fully working deployment playbook, deploying real code onto a real server.</p> <p>Rob Charlwood will give a talk on 'Using Dynamic secrets with Vault on Kubernetes'</p> <p>Tim Berry will give a talk on \"Learning Go for Cloud Native Apps\"</p> ",
