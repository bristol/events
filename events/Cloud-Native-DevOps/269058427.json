How hard can it be?</p> <p>You've written your application. Maybe this consists of some<br/>micro-services, maybe even some \"serverless\" functions. What you need<br/>now is a way to route external traffic to your app. Just stick an NGINX<br/>in front, right? Enter the API gateway service...</p> <p>We'll talk about the architecture of Oracle APIGW service - which is currently being built by teams in California and Bristol and is a global-scale multi-tenant service. We'll pull back the curtain on the implementation choices we made, discuss some of the trade-offs and describe how we ensure secure and efficient use of our hardware.</p> <p>19:05 - 19:35 Dan Jones (Customer Reliability Engineer, Jetstack) will speak on 'The Cloud Native Holy Trinity'</p> <p>This talk explores the cloud native options for quickly building applications in Google Cloud, including Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, GKE and Firebase.</p> ",
