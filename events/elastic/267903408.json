    "description": "<p>Due to the ongoing Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, it is with regret that we have decided to cancel our March event. The safety and wellbeing of our community is our highest priority.</p> <p>Keep an eye out for a rescheduled date and remember, if you have something to share, we're always in need of community speakers for future events. Not all talks require you to be the world's leading expert on your topic - real-world learning stories are also REALLY interesting and useful. We're very supportive of first time speakers too. Go on! You know you want to! Just get in touch with one of the organisers via Meetup or chat with one of our organisers at an event.</p> ",
