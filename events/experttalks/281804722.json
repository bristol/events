    "description": "<p>Find out how we took a major retailer from a proprietary online search solution to fully functional cloud-based microservices in time for the crucial Black Friday shopping period.</p> <p>Searching and browsing for products are the most important customer journeys for an online retailer. If a customer can\u2019t find a product they want to buy, then you can\u2019t sell it to them.<br/>How do you replatform this capability at a major high street retailer, with minimal disruption to customer experience and commercial performance, while improving availability and latency, and reducing costs?</p> <p>In this talk you will learn:<br/>- How we used You Build It, You Run It to move away from a traditional support model so that we could achieve multiple deployments per day instead of per week.<br/>- How we made decisions around product ownership and technical design so we could deliver early and quickly.<br/>- How we employed ways of working which encouraged team ownership and improved productivity.</p> <p>**<br/>This talk will be recorded and the link to the recording added to the Comments shortly after the event.<br/>**</p> ",
