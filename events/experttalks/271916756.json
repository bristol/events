This technology is in its infancy but I believe it offers a new way to think about how to deliver solutions to the modern marketplace.</p> <p>We have built and delivered the following products: KnownOrigin, niftyfootball.cards, CryptoKaiju.io, BlockCities.co and many more bespoke innovative solutions.</p> <p>Before BlockRocket I was an Equal Experts associate consultant and worked with the award-winning Coop Digital team transforming the Funeralcare business.</p> <p>I work with teams heavily involved test driven lean agile implementations. Through practical application I understand how this methodology can lead to significant benefits in quality and productivity.</p> ",
