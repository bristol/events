We'll explore why it exists and why it's so effective.</p> <p>You'll learn how ML models are built and used and how two classic but effective machine learning algorithms actually work - it's not all about deep neural networks!</p> <p>Finally, we talk about options for introducing machine learning to a product, with real life examples of what can go right and wrong.</p> <p>The slide deck we will share includes resources to help you continue your machine learning journey.</p> <p>SPEAKER: Paul Brabban. Machine Learning Engineer at Equal Experts</p> <p>Paul is a consultant in software development, data engineering and machine learning. He organised the SheffieldML machine learning meetup and (def shef) functional programming meetup between 2016 and 2019.<br/>You can find out more at\u00a0<a href=\"https://tempered.works\" class=\"linkified\">https://tempered.works</a>.</p> ",
