    "description": "<p>\"Your Digital Transformation isn\u2019t Digital or Transformation.... and will probably fail\"</p> <p>Using a range of real-life examples, this Expert Talk will explore the following ideas and questions:</p> <p>Not all change is transformation \u2013 and too much change, too quickly, is a recipe for failure not success.</p> <p>Digital is a means, not an end \u2013 Successful strategies are built around solving valuable problems that differentiate you in the market.</p> <p>Most transformations fail \u2013 Why? People are too busy and too scared of the unknown to readily accept the new. Many organisations make the mistake of emphasising the size of the transformation, to bounce colleagues out of a rut. This tends to mean failure through resistance.</p> <p>Why are people so busy and resistant to change? In this age of amazing technological advancements at work, incredible efficiencies have been made possible. Why aren\u2019t we working 15 hour weeks?</p> <p>SPEAKER: David Cox. Transformation Manager at Equal Experts</p> <p>David started out as a market researcher in the Publishing industry. He has since worked in B2B and B2C environments, with experience across Europe, the US and Australia.
