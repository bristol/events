We'll be dealing primarily with concepts but might look at a few lines of code too.</p> <p>SPEAKER<br/>**Marco Vermeulen**<br/>Lead author of \"Functional Programming in Kotlin\".</p> <p>\\*\\*<br/>This talk will be recorded and a link to the video added in the Comments shortly after the event takes place.</p> ",
