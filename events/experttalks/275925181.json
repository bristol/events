The most common negative comments were best paraphrased by, \u201cthis guy blames the developers, but it was the evil management.\u201d</p> <p>I think that this demonstrates a deep disconnect in our organisations and in what \u201cengineering\u201d for software means. In this talk, we will also explore how we should think about engineering in software terms, and why it matters</p> <p>SPEAKER: DAVE FARLEY</p> <p>Dave is the founder and director of Continuous Delivery Ltd.
