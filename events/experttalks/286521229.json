We\u2019ll also examine whether CUPID properties might sometimes be taken to extremes by engineers, and how that impacts software development outcomes.</p> <p>With thirty years experience in IT, [Daniel North](<a href=\"https://dannorth.net/bio/\" class=\"linkified\">https://dannorth.net/bio/</a>) is a technology and organisational change specialist who uses his deep technical and operational knowledge to help business and technology leaders to optimise digital product organisations. He puts people first, and finds simple, pragmatic solutions to business and technical problems, often using lean and agile techniques. Daniel talks to Equal Experts developers [Marco Vermeulen](<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/marco-vermeulen-1645421/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/marco-vermeulen-1645421/</a>) and [Natalia Oskina](<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalia-oskina/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalia-oskina/</a>), both of whom have extensive experience of using SOLID principles, and CUPID properties in software development.</p> <p>Listen to their examples of real engineering experiences involving SOLID principles and CUPID properties in software development, and find out how your engineers can leverage CUPID principles within your business.</p> <p>\\*\\*<br/>This talk will be recorded and the link to the recording adding in the Comments shortly after the event takes place.<br/>\\*\\*</p> ",
