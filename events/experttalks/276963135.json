There was a deeper phenomenon at play: colonialism.</p> <p>Male vs female customer segmentation. Emotional vs rational responses by users. Radical candour to achieve psychological safety.</p> <p>These are all easily accepted ideas that reflect post-Enlightenment Eurocentric ideas and values. Many of these ideas are (unsurprisingly) not shared by the majority of our planet\u2019s 7.6b inhabitants.</p> <p>Let\u2019s shed a light on some of these deeply held beliefs and assumptions, and share some practical steps we can take to have a truly inclusive approach to delivery.</p> <p>**</p> <p>SPEAKER:<br/>Neha Datt, Product Principal Consultant, Equal Experts.</p> <p>Neha is a senior digital advisor, agile leadership coach and conference speaker with a strong background in strategy, organisation design and human change.</p> <p>She has almost 20 years of collaborating with teams to deliver great products and services for global customers, across various industries.</p> <p>She is focusing now on ethical, sustainable, purpose-driven businesses.</p> <p>**</p> <p>This talk will be recorded and a link to the recording posted in the Comments shortly after the event.</p> <p>**</p> ",
