    "description": "<p>When organisations begin to adopt Continuous Delivery, engineering teams begin to deliver at a pace that can create a strain on other parts of the business. Security teams often struggle to adapt to this faster delivery model, but that doesn\u2019t need to be the case.<br/>In this talk, Stuart will discuss a few ways you can take advantage of continuous delivery to make security a first class citizen of software engineering. Grounding the theory with real world experience, he\u2019ll share a few stories of how other organisations have used these ideas to transform their delivery.</p> <p>SPEAKER: Stuart Gunter</p> <p>Stuart is the Security Practice Lead at Equal Experts. He has over 20 years experience in software engineering, architecture and security. He has worked with a variety of public and private sector organisations across a range of industries, helping them effectively embed security within agile delivery.</p> ",
