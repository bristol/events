    "description": "<p>We are facing one of the worst pandemics in Human history and also one of the largest crises of the last 100 years. Companies had to change their ways-of-working in a matter of weeks and some had to completely reinvent themselves.</p> <p>In this conversation we will share a story of two friends that created two different companies, one remote-first and the other an office-first. How will one help the other change towards a remote environment?</p> <p>We will share our experiences of working in an agile environment with remote teams for the past 4 years (different projects in several countries), explaining the steps that need to be done in order to have a fully functional team, pitfalls to avoid and tips and tricks in order for you to be able to try it in your team.</p> <p>SPEAKERS:<br/>Carlos Ros\u00e3o, Senior Software Engineer, Equal Experts, Portugal<br/>Nuno Silva Pereira, Delivery Lead, Equal Experts, Portugal</p> ",
