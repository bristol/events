Unlike scanning and firewalling, this approach establishes a safe and powerful way for development, security, and operations teams to collaborate.</p> <p>We\u2019ll discuss how software security instrumentation works, how it\u2019s being used in many organizations, and the implications for the practice of application security..</p> <p>SPEAKER:<br/>Jeff Williams, CTO and Co-Founder Contrast Security</p> <p>Jeff brings more than 20 years of security leadership experience as co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of Contrast Security.</p> <p>He recently authored the DZone DevSecOps, IAST, and RASP refcards and speaks frequently at conferences including JavaOne (Java Rockstar), BlackHat, QCon, RSA, OWASP, Velocity, and PivotalOne.</p> <p>Jeff is also a founder and major contributor to OWASP, where he served as Global Chairman for 9 years, and created the OWASP Top 10, OWASP Enterprise Security API, OWASP Application Security Verification Standard, XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet, and many more popular open source projects.</p> <p>Jeff has a BA from Virginia, an MA from George Mason, and a JD from Georgetown. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/planetlevel/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/planetlevel/</a></p> <p>**<br/>The link to the recording of this Talk will be posted in the Comments shortly after the Talk takes place.</p> ",
