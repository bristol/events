Yet many of those are not achieving the benefits and results expected. So what is holding them back from really making the step-change?</p> <p>Well, one of these is addressing how they budget and fund their ideas.<br/>They implement agile frameworks, restructure into tribes and squads but still seem to struggle to turn those ideas into reality.</p> <p>You cannot introduce \"new ways of working\" without systemically tackling how the work is funded, prioritised and delivered. Otherwise, it's business as usual.</p> <p>In this talk, we will discuss how organisations got to this state and their way out. We will talk about some misconceptions about productivity and alternative approaches</p> <p>SPEAKER:</p> <p>Join Tony Nguyen (Director Transformation and Delivery at Equal Experts APAC), as he discusses how an organisations funding and budgeting approach impacts its ability to innovate and deliver at speed. Tony started his career working at global software product companies and since his return to Australia has been helping apply those concepts to enterprise corporations; Including Transformations at Optus, Westpac, and CBA.</p> <p>***<br/>This talk will be recorded and a link to the recording placed in the Comments shortly after the event.<br/>***</p> ",
