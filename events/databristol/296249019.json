Tamsin will kick things off by outlining the landscape of Human-Centred AI (HCAI), an interdisciplinary field which furthers AI to complement human capabilities, needs, and values. Tamsin will then dive into the topic of her research master\u2019s: interactive AI for creative collaboration. Seeing as speech is a crucial mode of human-AI interaction, Alexandra will explore the fascinating journey of how speech interaction evolved: from chatbots, to smart devices and even to multimodal general artificial intelligence (GAI). She will talk about the importance of natural, human-like speech interaction, as well as the crucial aspect of speech privacy.
