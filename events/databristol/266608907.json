We'll decide/update the specific pub nearer the time, but it will be one of the fine establishments on King Street in central Bristol (near the fountains and Queens Square).</p> <p>All welcome, send me a message if you're not sure you'll be able to spot us, and we'll liaise to make sure you can find us :)</p> <p>Also keep an eye out for details about a PyData talk and social on 19th December - we'll post a link to it on our meetup site when available...</p> ",
