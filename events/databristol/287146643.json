How do you enable secure data movement into your data platform? How do you easily move data around in private networks? Azure provides many options beyond the default Azure-hosted Integration Runtime but which one is right and how do we set them up?<br/>\u00a0<br/>In this talk I will explore how the different types of Data Factory and Synapse Integration Runtimes can be used to access and transfer data in a secure network topology. I will discuss some common secure architectures and explain how Integration Runtimes can fit into these designs to facilitate simple yet secure data integration.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Bio: I am an Azure data engineering consultant with a passion for infrastructure, networking, and security. I have 5 years\u2019 experience working with data, 4 of which have focussed on the Microsoft Data Platform. I'm a Microsoft Certified Developer, and I also co-founded DevUp, a social mobility initiative for removing barriers to technology.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/grace-o-halloran/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/grace-o-halloran/</a></p> <p>\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-</p> <p>19.20 \u2013 19:40 Break &amp; Pizza</p> <p>\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-</p> <p>19:40 - 20:30 Talk 2# **Simon Whitely**</p> <p>\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-</p> <p>20:30 - Chat and pub</p> <p>**EVENT SPONSORS**</p> <p>We would like to thank our generous sponsors for supporting us:<br/>Immersive Labs (<a href=\"https://www.immersivelabs.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.immersivelabs.com/</a>), Huboo (<a href=\"https://www.huboo.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.huboo.com/</a>)</p> <p>**WHEN AND WHERE**</p> <p>The venue is: Immersive Labs, 6th Floor, The Programme, All Saints' St, Bristol BS1 2LZ</p> ",
