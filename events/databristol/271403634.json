SQL has various different high availability solutions but can you be sure that they'll react as expected to a real world issue? Has your HA architecture only ever been tested in a planned maintenance window?</p> <p>How can we test potential weaknesses in SQL Server with Chaos Engineering experiments? We'll go through how to identify issues and then run an experiment.</p> <p>We'll also have some fun by looking at KubeInvaders, a chaos engineering tool for Kubernetes...using Space Invaders!</p> <p>This session is for SQL Server DBAs and Developers who want to know how Chaos Engineering works and want to learn its main principles.</p> <p>SPEAKER<br/>Andrew Pruski</p> <p>BIO<br/>SQL Server DBA originally from Wales but now exploring Ireland. I'm a SQL Server DBA, Microsoft Data Platform MVP, and Certified Kubernetes Administrator. You can find me on twitter @dbafromthecold and blogging at dbafromthecold.com</p> ",
