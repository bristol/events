Each topic covered in this session will be accompanied with live demos.</p> <p>Andrew Pruski is a SQL Server DBA, Microsoft Data Platform MVP, and Certified Kubernetes Administrator.

Based on an entirely subjective choice of 4-5 scenarios and examples seen in the field, its intended to guide people to write more efficient and performant SQL and expand the understanding of the options developers and engineers have when writing queries.</p> <p>Phil has spent over 20 years down the data mines, working for household names and total unknowns. He knows a fair bit about BI and data warehousing using SQL Server and Azure. He also takes an interest in automation, development lifecycle and what is now known as DevOps, but don\u2019t hold that against him. Outside of that you might see him hacking around Bristol on a bike, sometimes for charity. If you buy him a drink he might tell you about the time a Nokia executive told him Apple don\u2019t know anything about phones</p> <p>\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-</p> <p>20:30 - Chat and pub</p> <p>**EVENT SPONSORS**</p> <p>We would like to thank our generous sponsors for supporting us:<br/>Immersive Labs (<a href=\"https://www.immersivelabs.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.immersivelabs.com/</a>), Huboo (<a href=\"https://www.huboo.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.huboo.com/</a>)</p> <p>**WHEN AND WHERE**</p> <p>The venue is: Immersive Labs, The Programme, All Saints\u2019 St, Bristol, United Kingdom, BS1 2LZ</p> ",
