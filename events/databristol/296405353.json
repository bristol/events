Are the concepts so abstract that it\u2019s hard to translate the principals into real world requirements and maybe even harder to think about what technology you might need to deploy within your Azure tenant.</p> <p>In this session, we\u2019ll explore options for building scalable data products in Azure, following Data Mesh architecture principals. Turning the theory into practice. What data storage technology should be used? Does it matter? What endpoints should be exposed for the products across the overall mesh? And what resource(s) should sit at the centre of the Data Mesh? Answers to all these questions are more as we turn the theory of a Data Mesh architecture into practice. Including, how to dissect the planes of the Data Mesh using Azure concepts.</p> <p>\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-</p> <p>**19:15 - 19:45 Pizza and Networking**</p> <p>\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-</p> <p>**19:45 - 20:30 Migrating to Azure - Panel QnA** with \\*\\*[Paul Andrew](<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrpaulandrew/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrpaulandrew/</a>), [Rob Sewell ](<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/robsewellsqldba/)\\*\\*and\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/robsewellsqldba/)\\*\\*and</a> **[Dan Addy](<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-addy/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-addy/</a>)**</p> <p>Bring your questions and challenges about migrating to Azure Data Platform for an open question-and-answer session with an exceptionally skilled and experienced panel!
