    "description": "<p>The SQL Bristol meetup is informal and friendly, usually around 40 people. It's a great opportunity to network with folk either interested in, or who work with SQL, and learn something new from our great speakers. We also have free pizza and drinks from our kind sponsors Just Eat. Afterwards some of us head to a local pub for a bit more relaxing and chatting. Feel free to come along.</p> <p>Alex Yates (Twitter @_AlexYates_) will be presenting DevOps, Dev Data and the GDPR: 5 Solutions.</p> <p>Alex Yates has been helping organisations to apply DevOps principles to relational database development and deployment since 2010.
