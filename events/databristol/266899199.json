It plugs in to Excel to provide data stewards a familiar, easy way to provide manual master data to the data warehouse. The data is validated and stored in a central database which your ETL can pull from.</p> <p>It hasn't changed a lot along the SQL lifespan. The differences will be mentioned in the talk.</p> <p>John is the organiser of the Subject Data: Bristol meetup (formerly Data Bristol). He is a Microsoft Data consultant with 8 years experience, mainly in finance, following 6 years as a web systems engineer.<br/><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-kirby-2b252154/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-kirby-2b252154/</a></p> <p>----------<br/>20:30 - Pub<br/>----------</p> <p>EVENT SPONSORS<br/>----------<br/>We would like to thank our generous sponsors for supporting us:</p> <p>Just Eat (<a href=\"https://www.just-eat.co.uk/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.just-eat.co.uk/</a>)</p> <p>WHEN AND WHERE<br/>----------<br/>The venue is: Just Eat, Broad Quay House, Broad Quay, Bristol BS1 4DJ.
