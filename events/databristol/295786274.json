MLOps streamlines the process of taking machine learning models to production, and then maintaining and monitoring them. With new MLOps micro-venders popping up every day, is there a tool that does everything?</p> <p>In this session, we will consider Databricks as an end-to-end MLOps tool, exploring collaborative workspaces, feature stores, model registries and model serving. We will also touch upon other critical MLOps practices such as model fairness, explainability and monitoring.</p> <p>Including practical demos of Databricks Feature Store, MLFlow and real-time Model Serving, this session is suitable for Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers of all levels.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tompkinstori/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/tompkinstori/</a></p> <p>\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-</p> <p>**20:30 - Pub**</p> <p>\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-</p> <p>**About Amdaris**</p> <p>Of course, we\u2019re obsessed with cutting-edge technology but it\u2019s how much we care about people that sets us apart.
