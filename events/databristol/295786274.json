These distributed computing tools can take a while to learn, and often teams migrating older premises data warehouses to cloud solutions like the lake house concentrate on getting good data over getting the best performance.</p> <p>However in the cloud, any performance improvements can have a big impact on monthly cost, making it much easier to to justify spending time getting things running faster and more efficiently. This talk aims to help point you at common pain points when working with Spark using Databricks or Fabric, showing you where to look, and what to look for, and what can be done to improve things.</p> <p>\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-</p> <p>**19:15 - 19:45 Pizza and Networking**</p> <p>\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-</p> <p>**19:45 - 20:30 Want End-to-End MLOps?** **Look no further than Databricks!** by **Tori Tompkins**</p> <p>Arguably the largest challenge in ML today is effectively deploying reliable and efficient models into production, with experts quoting that as many as 90% of model created never make it to production. MLOps streamlines the process of taking machine learning models to production, and then maintaining and monitoring them. With new MLOps micro-venders popping up every day, is there a tool that does everything?</p> <p>In this session, we will consider Databricks as an end-to-end MLOps tool, exploring collaborative workspaces, feature stores, model registries and model serving. We will also touch upon other critical MLOps practices such as model fairness, explainability and monitoring.</p> <p>Including practical demos of Databricks Feature Store, MLFlow and real-time Model Serving, this session is suitable for Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers of all levels.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tompkinstori/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/tompkinstori/</a></p> <p>\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-</p> <p>**20:30 - Pub**</p> <p>\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-<br/>**Notes**</p> <p>* **Photos**: We, and potentially others, take photos of our meetups which are shared (e.g. on our meetup group, print publicity; social media, etc.).
