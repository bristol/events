Now, the Delta Lake takes the prim.<br/>Why people do confuse it with Parquet and always talk about files in this case?</p> <p>In this session, we'll take a look at the evolution of ETL into ELT and its storage aspect, which explain why it is \"a must\" for modern data warehouse solutions and how is it related Delta Lake technology in cloud environments like Databricks or Synapse Analytics. Finally, we'll check what's Delta-Parquet creature presented in Microsoft Fabric OneLake recently. We will see also what data layers (stages) are commonly set up and why they make sense.</p> <p>\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-</p> <p>**19:15 - 19:45 Pizza and Networking**</p> <p>\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-</p> <p>**19:45 - 20:30 Better ETL with Managed Airflow in ADF** by **[Niall Langley](<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/niall-langley/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/niall-langley/</a>)**</p> <p>Building complex data workflows using Azure Data Factory can get a little clunky - as you orchestration needs get more complex you hit limitations like not being able to nest loops or conditionals, running simple Python, bash or PowerShell scripts is difficult, and costs can grow quickly as you are charged per task execution. Recently another option become available, Managed Airflow in ADF.</p> <p>Apace Airflow is a code-centric open-source platform for developing, scheduling and monitoring batch-based data workflows, built using the python language Data Engineers know and love. But until Managed Airflow, getting it working in Azure was a complex task for customers more used to PaaS services such as ADF, Databricks and Fabric. It is also an important ETL orchestrator on AWS and GCP, so cross cloud compatibility becomes simpler to achieve.</p> <p>In this session we\u2019ll look at what Airflow is, how it\u2019s different from ADF, and what advantages Managed Airflow in ADF gives us. We talk about the idea of a DAG for building the workflow, and then work through some demos to show just how easy it is to use Python to write an Airflow DAG\u2019s and import them into the Managed Airflow Environment as pipelines. We then dive into the excellent monitoring UI and find out just how easy is it to trigger a pipeline, view it to see the dependencies between tasks, and monitor runs.</p> <p>By the end of the session attendees will have a good understanding of what Airflow is, when to use it, and how it fits into the Azure Data Platform.</p> <p>\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-</p> <p>**20:30 - Pub**</p> <p>\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-</p> <p>**About Origin Workspace - [<a href=\"https://originworkspace.co.uk/](https://originworkspace.co.uk/\" class=\"linkified\">https://originworkspace.co.uk/](https://originworkspace.co.uk/</a>)**</p> <p>Origin Workspace is designed to meet the changing needs of today's entrepreneurs, small and growing businesses, ambitious consultants, freelancers and remote workers.
