This kind of atmosphere has occurred before.\u00a0My talk will be about the Digesting Duck, a clockwork-driven robot duck which was a sensation across Europe in the 18th Century. I\u2019ll describe some links between the Digesting Duck and modern AI, both in terms of technological development, and of the philosophical questions raised in discussions about them. What can be learned from the Digesting Duck that is applicable to modern AI?</p> <p>**BIO**<br/>Miranda Mowbray is an honorary lecturer at the University of Bristol, where she teaches ethics for AI. She is not a robot, honest.\u00a0</p> <p>**19:10 - 19:40 Pizza and Networking**</p> <p>**19:40 - 20:30 (TBC)**</p> <p>Hosted and Sponsored by BJSS - [www.bjss.com](<a href=\"https://www.bjss.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.bjss.com/</a>) \\- a leading technology and engineering consultancy for business\\.</p> <p>Pizzas and Drinks during the event - thanks BJSS!</p> <p>\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-<br/>**About BJSS - [<a href=\"https://www.bjss.com/](https://www.bjss.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.bjss.com/](https://www.bjss.com/</a>)**<br/>BJSS is a leading technology and engineering consultancy for business.
