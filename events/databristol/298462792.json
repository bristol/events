Such as Azure SQL Databases, Azure SQL VMs, Azure Arc Enabled Managed Instances, Azure Databricks or Azure Data Factory for example. You will want to ensure that they are all logging to Log Analytics and have monitoring enabled, maybe you need all of them to have Private Endpoints set up.</p> <p>But you will forget something, you will mistype something, you will need to create multiple environments and they will need to be the same. Manually creating things is time consuming and mistake prone. Humans make mistakes.</p> <p>Come and join me and I will show you how to deploy your data infrastructure into Azure using Bicep and Azure DevOps. How to ensure that when you deploy your resources, you automatically include Log Analytics or monitoring or add Private Endpoints.</p> <p>You will learn<br/>\u2022 What Bicep is<br/>\u2022 How to compose Bicep with VS Code<br/>\u2022 How to create a pipeline in Azure DevOps to deploy the code<br/>\u2022 How to add Logging and Monitoring to your Azure Data Platform<br/>\u2022 How to create modules so that you can ensure that you deploy all of the resources that you require quickly, easily and repeatedly</p> <p>You are<br/>\u2022 Someone interested in Infrastructure as Code for cloud data resources<br/>\u2022 Interested in learning new things<br/>\u2022 Want to deploy consistently to Azure<br/>\u2022 Never heard of Bicep or pipelines</p> <p>\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-</p> <p>**20:30 - Pub**</p> <p>\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-<br/>**Notes**</p> <p>* **Bicycle parking**: We do *not* have arrangements with the venue for secure storage.
