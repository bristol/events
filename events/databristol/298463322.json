There are several available but Kubernetes really did win the \"orchestrator war\".</p> <p>It's now the defacto standard for managing large numbers of containers in production but Kubernetes does have a lot of moving parts.</p> <p>Join Microsoft Data Platform MVP, Andrew Pruski, in this session to dive into Kubernetes and learn about its various components.</p> <p>First off we'll look at the various control node components: -<br/>\\- The apiserver\\, the front end for the Kubernetes control plane<br/>\\- Etcd\\, a key value store for all the cluster data<br/>\\- The kube\\-scheduler\\, which assigns pods to a node</p> <p>Kubernetes can have multiple control nodes and we'll go over the various different considerations for making the control plane of Kubernetes highly available.</p> <p>Then we'll dive into the different worker node components: -<br/>\\- The kubelet\\, responsible for ensuring containers are running in a pod<br/>\\- The container runtime\\, which options do we have? \\(docker\\, containerd\\, etc\\.\\.\\)</p> <p>Once we've gone over all the node components we will then cover deploying applications to Kubernetes, using SQL Server as an example: -<br/>\\- What is the difference between deployments\\, daemonsets\\, and statefulsets?<br/>\\- How to connect to our app in Kubernetes \\(services\\)<br/>\\- Adjusting pod eviction timings for high availability<br/>\\- Persisting data for SQL Server</p> <p>This session is for anyone who wants to learn more about the internals of Kubernetes.</p> <p>\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-</p> <p>**19:15 - 19:45 Pizza and Networking**</p> <p>\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-</p> <p>**19:45 - 20:30 Databricks** by **[Grace O'Halloran](<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/grace-o-halloran/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/grace-o-halloran/</a>)**</p> <p>Details coming soon.</p> <p>\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-</p> <p>**20:30 - Pub**</p> <p>\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-<br/>**About Armada House - [<a href=\"https://armadahousebristol.com/](https://armadahousebristol.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://armadahousebristol.com/](https://armadahousebristol.com</a>)**</p> <p>Armada House is a gorgeous new events venue in the heart of Bristol\u2019s Old City.</p> <p>Step into the grand Edwardian foyer of Armada House, with its glittering chandelier, marble flooring and unique original features.
