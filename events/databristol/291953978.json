They are a bit clunkier, and require a developer to jump through more hoops to achieve the same results as they could with another product.<br/>However, this is largely because they are not just designed as a source control tool. In fact, I would argue their primary purpose is to turn a database into a coding project, and being able to put that project under source control is just one of the benefits that come with that.<br/>In this session I will take you through what I mean by that, how you can leverage this technology, and why you would want to use it over other source control systems. This will be a mix of slides to go through some of the principals involved, and demos that will import databases into database projects and deploy them back out to a server. In doing this I will cover what it means to turn a database into a code project, including features like easy refactoring, code validation, and (most exciting) the ability to split your database across several projects, and re-use code from one project across many databases.</p> <p>\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-<br/>**19:15 - 19:45 Pizza and Networking**<br/>\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-</p> <p>**19:45 - 20:30 Talking the \u201cPublic\u201d out of Public Clouds: Getting Started with Azure Private Endpoints by Grace O'Halloran**</p> <p>If you're working in the cloud, sooner or later you'll come across someone who cries out that the cloud is not secure, that your data is exposed to the internet as a whole. With the right structures in place, this is simply not true\u2026 but what are the right structures? How do you go about changing a public-facing resource into a private resource only accessible from your own networks, whilst still retaining all the benefits of the cloud? This is where private endpoints come in - they're a powerful tool you can use to secure your Azure data estate.</p> <p>We\u2019ll begin by covering what a private endpoint is and why they make your platform more secure. We\u2019ll then go through the core elements required to facilitate private endpoint connectivity, including Private DNS Zones, A Records and Virtual Network Links. We\u2019ll also step through a demo of how to deploy and configure a private endpoint, and we\u2019ll wrap up by discussing some common mistakes to avoid when working with private endpoints.</p> <p>\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-<br/>**20:30 - Pub**<br/>\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-</p> ",
