In forty six minutes they changed the way millions of people would think about the software delivery process for years to come. It didn\u2019t have a name yet, but DevOps was born. DevOps folk preached about the cloud, automation, rapid delivery and any database technology that wasn\u2019t relational.</p> <p>In 2013 Kenny Gorman declared \u201cThe DBA is Dead\u201d.</p> <p>For the record, we don't believe that, but a lot of people do. What is certain is that the world of IT is changing and traditional roles are changing with it. We all need to adapt.</p> <p>In this interactive talk we will explain what DevOps is, where it came from, and its implications for SQL Server. We'll demo example solutions to some of the foundational technical challenges (source control and test/deployment automation) and we will leave plenty of time at the end to answer your questions.</p> <p><b>Talk #2: Speaker: Luke Merrett (short talk)<br/></b></p> <p><b>NoSQL...for people who like SQL</b></p> <p>In 2010 NoSQL databases surged in popularity in response to the increasing need to scale rapidly whilst serving more data to users in less time.</p> <p>But what is \"NoSQL\"?\u00a0 What does BASE consistency mean?\u00a0 And why does it have such a misleading name?</p> <p>We'll walk through the philosophies of the NoSQL class of databases, how they differentiate from SQL Server &amp; when you may choose to use them.</p> <p>Whilst we're at it, we'll look at the difference between ACID and BASE and how to cater for eventual consistency.</p> <p><b>Biographies</b></p> <p><b>Alex Yates </b><a href=\"https://twitter.com/_AlexYates_\">@_AlexYates_</a></p> <p>DevOps Expert, Principal Consultant, Microsoft Data Platform MVP</p> <p>Alex has been helping organisations to apply DevOps principles to relational database development and deployment since 2010.
