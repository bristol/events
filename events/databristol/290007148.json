SELECT few ;) (sorry, couldn't resist...), an informal social evening in the pub to celebrate a great year of data meetups!</p> <p>All welcome, please let us know if you're coming by RSVP'ing to this meetup as we'll try and book space in a pub.</p> <p>We're aiming for The Famous Royal Navy Volunteer on King Street. Hopefully we'll have a table reserved (I've just emailed, following lack of availability at the original pub we were planning to meet at), otherwise we'll try to grab space as it becomes available.</p> <p>If you're planning to come and haven't joined us previously, I'll have a 'Data Bristol' meetup sign out on a table/please message me or post in the discussion for this meetup with any questions.</p> ",
