SELECT few ;) (sorry, couldn't resist...), an informal social evening in the pub to celebrate a great year of data meetups!</p> <p>All welcome, please let us know if you're coming by RSVP'ing to this meetup as we'll try and book space in a pub.</p> <p>We're currently aiming for 'Hole in the Wall' (by Queens Square). Will confirm/update nearer the time but if they can't accomodate us it will be somewhere nearby (probably a pub on King Street instead).</p> <p>If you're planning to come and haven't joined us previously, I'll have a 'Data Bristol' meetup sign out on a table/please message me or post in the discussion for this meetup with any questions.</p> ",
