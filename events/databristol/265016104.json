Then we'll build it automatically upon<br/>commit, and deploy it to Azure at the click of a button with Azure DevOps<br/>Services.</p> <p>We'll also discuss some of the common blockers and how they can be resolved.<br/>For example, we'll discuss shared development databases, branching plans and<br/>masking production data for development.</p> <p>You'll leave this session with a better understanding of how to deliver<br/>working software more regularly and more reliably, enabling you to respond<br/>better to business demands.</p> <p><a href=\"http://workingwithdevs.com/speaking/\" class=\"linkified\">http://workingwithdevs.com/speaking/</a></p> <p>----------<br/>19.20 \u2013 19:40 Break &amp; Pizza<br/>----------</p> <p>19:40 - 20:30<br/>TALK #2 \u2013 Phil Austin; details tbc.</p> <p>----------<br/>20:30 - Pub<br/>----------</p> <p>EVENT SPONSORS<br/>----------<br/>We would like to thank our generous sponsors for supporting us:</p> <p>Just Eat (<a href=\"https://www.just-eat.co.uk/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.just-eat.co.uk/</a>)</p> <p>WHEN AND WHERE<br/>----------<br/>Provisionally, the venue is: Just Eat, Broad Quay House, Broad Quay, Bristol BS1 4DJ.
