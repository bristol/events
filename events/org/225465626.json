This bill will be going to parliament soon so it's vital to educate our MPs about it.</p> <p>We'll provide talking points and relevant material and we'll practice what to say and how. You can meet other people at this meeting so that you can lobby as part of a group - which is less daunting if it's your first time.</p> <p>(Note: this is to prepare for meeting your MP, who won't actually be at this meeting - that comes later)</p> <p>Agenda</p> <p>\u2022 Why are we lobbying MPs</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Background</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0What are the main<br/>concerns?</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0What are the positions of<br/>the political parties?</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Talking to your MP</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0What your MP might say</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0What MPs have said</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0What else can I do?</p> ",
