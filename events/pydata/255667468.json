Pre-requisites and hard-core mathematics will be kept to a minimum to make it as accessible to all as possible.<br/>Please register in advance on eventbrite and ensure you bring your laptop with the the various pre-requisites installed.<br/><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/intro-to-recurrent-neural-networks-tickets-52401888459\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/intro-to-recurrent-neural-networks-tickets-52401888459</a></p> <p>\ud83d\udcca TALKS<br/>=========<br/>Enrico Rotundo on \"JupyterLab &amp; its extensions: towards a broad open source ecosystem\"<br/>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br/>I\u2019ll share some insights and ideas regarding JupyterLab and its modular architecture. This has been a major topic at JupyterCon 2018 and it\u2019s deemed to enable unprecedented functionalities for the end users. Developers can now extend the system by writing widgets that implement new data science functionalities. Available extensions already added integrations with tools like git, matplotlib, GitHub and Latex. Shortly, there\u2019ll be a complete ecosystem of open source extensions that'll redefine the user experience. I\u2019ll share some ideas to better expose your extensions to the final users by solely relying on free and open source services. The talk is accessible to data scientists, developers and product owners that work with the Jupyter stack.</p> <p>Bio : <a href=\"https://enricorotundo.github.io/pages/bio.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://enricorotundo.github.io/pages/bio.html</a></p> <p>Vaclav Pohoriljak on \"Information Archeology\"<br/>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br/>A definition of \"information archeology\"<br/>- Case studies:<br/>1.

He then worked as IT professional in investment banking, TV manufacturing and the gaming industry. He applied financial (cost-revenue), game theoretical, econometrical and macro-modelling principles on dynamic IT world. He will explain how these principles enable good analysis, but require relevant data to make analysis accurate.</p> <p>\u26a1\ufe0f LIGHTNING TALKS<br/>=====================</p> <p>1.
