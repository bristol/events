But most of you will have no idea why, so we'll need a short introduction to how every semiconductor device you've ever used is made (it's using plasmas). Plasmas are a uniquely challenging environment to make any useful measurements of. We will show how unsupervised learning can be used to make sense of complex diagnostic data for controlling plasma processing and creating useful generative models.</p> <p>Greg is the lead of the data-driven innovation team at Oxford Instruments Plasma Technology and a doctoral researcher at the University of Exeter in the Sustainable Materials and Manufacturing CDT. Greg's research focuses on application of AI and deep learning in semiconductor manufacturing and plasma physics.</p> <p>\\# \ud83d\udd56 LOGISTICS<br/>Talks kick off at 18:30 sharp; then networking/beers in The Knights Templar from 20:40.<br/>If you realise you can't make it, please un-RSVP in good time to free up your place for your fellow community members.<br/>Follow @pydatabristol (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/pydatabristol\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/pydatabristol</a>) for updates on this and future events, as well as news from the global PyData community.<br/>\\# \ud83d\udcdc CODE OF CONDUCT<br/>The PyData Code of Conduct governs this meetup (<a href=\"https://pydata.org/code-of-conduct/\" class=\"linkified\">https://pydata.org/code-of-conduct/</a>).
