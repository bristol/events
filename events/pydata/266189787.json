Mike O'Connor on \"Python Frameworks for Interactive Scientific Visualisation in Virtual Reality\"</p> <p>In this talk, Mike O'Connor will present Narupa, a virtual reality tool for interactive scientific visualization. The open-source Python-based software combines high-performance computing with rigorous physics simulations to allow researchers to visualize and interact with the nanoscopic world, and enable them to intuitively reason about the complex molecular structures and the high dimensional datasets they produce. Mike will present some of the unique challenges that arise when combining HPC, simulation and data science with aspects of game design in virtual reality.</p> <p>Dr. Mike O'Connor is a Research Associate at the Intangible Realities Lab, University of Bristol.</p> <p>2.
