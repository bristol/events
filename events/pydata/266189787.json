Mike O'Connor on \"Python Frameworks for Interactive Scientific Visualisation in Virtual Reality\"</p> <p>In this talk, Mike O'Connor will present Narupa, a virtual reality tool for interactive scientific visualization. The open-source Python-based software combines high-performance computing with rigorous physics simulations to allow researchers to visualize and interact with the nanoscopic world, and enable them to intuitively reason about the complex molecular structures and the high dimensional datasets they produce. Mike will present some of the unique challenges that arise when combining HPC, simulation and data science with aspects of game design in virtual reality.</p> <p>Dr. Mike O'Connor is a Research Associate at the Intangible Realities Lab, University of Bristol.</p> <p>2. John Sandall on \"How To Forecast An Election\"</p> <p>Learn about the field of psephology, a division of political science that deals with the examination and statistical analysis of elections and political polling. Psephology and the polling are a powerful force in contemporary politics. They shape our political narratives around elections, govern the news cycle and act as powerful social proof of a campaign\u2019s success or failure.</p> <p>As trust in polling declines and as technology begins to unlock new sources of political information, we ask what is the future of this discipline and how will it affect campaigning? How do psephologists calculate results and turnout? What kind of models, approaches and data do psephologists currently use? Can new approaches be developed using data science techniques which are emerging from different sectors?</p> <p>\u26a1\ufe0f LIGHTNING TALKS<br/>=====================</p> <p>1.
