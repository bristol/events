    "description": "<p>We are delighted to bring to you Bristol's fourth PyData meetup!</p> <p>We'd like to thank our generous hosts OVO Energy for providing the venue and also IBM for sponsorship of the food and refreshments.</p> <p>Expect two 30-minute talks, plus two 5-minute lightning talks, plus community announcements.</p> <p>*NEW* PRE-MEETUP DEEP LEARNING WORKSHOP \"An Intro to Deep Learning with Keras\"<br/>===============================<br/>We are hosting an optional, fun and free \u201cpre-meetup\u201d workshop also at Ovo Energy, from 5pm-6:30pm, entitled \u201cAn Intro to Deep Learning with Keras\u201d and run by our very own John Sandall.<br/>If you wish to attend please sign up to the separate Eventbrite event via this link: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/pydata-bristol-keras-workshop\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/pydata-bristol-keras-workshop</a>, and bring your laptop with the pre-requisites installed.<br/>(Only 20 places available)</p> <p>\ud83d\udcca TALKS<br/>=========<br/>\"Controlling Aircraft with Deep Reinforcement Learning\" by Gordon Rennie<br/>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br/>Reinforcement learning is a branch of machine learning in which agents learn how to act in a human-like way: through repeated interactions with their environment. Combining reinforcement learning with deep neural nets has recently enabled exciting advances in the field, such as human-champion level performance in the boardgame Go, control in complex robotics tasks, and defeating teams of professional players in DotA 2. In this talk I will give an overview of reinforcement learning and deep reinforcement learning, and look at some of their applications. As a more concrete example, we will examine my dissertation project where I integrated the open-source flight simulation engine JSBSim into a deep RL system, and trained agents to fly planes \u2013 all in Python!</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gordon-rennie/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/gordon-rennie/</a></p> <p>Mike O'Connor on \"Hand pose classification in VR using Tensorflow\"<br/>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br/>I'll be presenting some experiences and lessons learned in using Tensorflow Premade Estimators to prototype a classifier for detecting hand poses from a pair of virtual reality gloves. The talk will be accessible to beginners in machine learning and Tensorflow interested in rapid prototyping of machine learning applications with neural networks.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Mike O'Connor (@mikeoconnor0308) is a computer scientist currently pursuing a PhD at the University of Bristol, with research interests in high-performance computing, machine learning and human-computer interaction.</p> <p>\u26a1\ufe0f LIGHTNING TALKS<br/>=====================</p> <p>1.
