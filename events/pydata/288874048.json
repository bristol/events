In this talk, we review our journey in looking at a few solving algorithms, and see them fail, and come up with alternative attempts using optimisation solutions. Along the way, we also create a useful set of abstractions that we are able to consume effectively. The algorithms explored, in order, are:<br/>Brute-force search, Backtracking method, Genetic algorithm, Particle Swarm and Simulated Annealing.</p> <p>Sudarsan is a Solution Consultant at Sahaj AI Software, where he is focusing on robust, useful applications that don\u2019t break. Breaking down problems and thinking through them is his favourite pastime.<br/>Sudarsan holds a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Mechatronics from SASTRA University, India, and has done a Game Play Design course at University of Aarhus, Denmark.</p> <p>**2\\. Alon Samuel** on **How to issue applicable research experiments with DVC and VScode**.<br/>How to build a pipeline from raw data into a working model with results with DVC.\u00a0<br/>Track changes with VS code. And the power of changing and researching each step of the way while keeping the pipeline working.\u00a0</p> <p>Alon is working as a senior Data Scientist at Polecat.com ltd - with NLP models. Before that he was a data scientist and a team leader at Razorlabs working on computer vision and NN for various customers. He has a bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering and Physics from Tel Aviv Uni.</p> <p>3. **Hanson Bharth** on **TBC**</p> <p>4. **Frank Kelly** on **An Introduction to Tsetlin Machines**<br/>The Tsetlin Machine is a type of automata-based machine learning model that learns expressions from propositional logic. Frank will go over its inner workings, benefits/downsides over traditional machine learning approaches and explain how you can use them too.<br/>Frank is a Principal Data Scientist at Sahaj.ai, organiser at PyData Bristol with an engineering-focused, multi-domain background (including aerospace, shipping, tech startups, smart cities and offshore oil &amp; gas). He also works on side projects focused on data-driven, environmental causes.</p> <p># \ud83d\udd56 LOGISTICS</p> <p>Talks kick off at 18:30 sharp; then networking/beers in either one of the nearby Punchbowl or Barley Mow pubs from 20:40.<br/>If you realise you can't make it, please un-RSVP in good time to free up your place for your fellow community members.<br/>Follow @pydatabristol (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/pydatabristol\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/pydatabristol</a>) for updates on this and future events, as well as news from the global PyData community.</p> <p># \ud83d\udcdc CODE OF CONDUCT</p> <p>The PyData Code of Conduct governs this meetup (<a href=\"https://pydata.org/code-of-conduct/\" class=\"linkified\">https://pydata.org/code-of-conduct/</a>).
