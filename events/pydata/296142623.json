Initial attempts using off-the-shelf models like TextBlob and Bert were not accurate enough due to the unique language in the gaming domain.<br/>Holding onto the academic mindset, they contemplated creating a bespoke sentiment classifier, only to discover the lack of clean, labeled data specific to their domain\u2014a stark contrast to academic settings.<br/>Ultimately, rather than building a tool from scratch, the solution lay in fine-tuning existing models from Hugging Face, augmenting data with synthetic inputs from LLMs, and capitalizing on few-shot classification to address data limitations.<br/>The speaker believes that early-career data scientists will benefit from this talk. It provides insights into the practical application of data science and NLP in a business context, highlighting the emphasis on speed and efficiency, as opposed to the academic focus on achieving the highest accuracy in a model.<br/>\u200c</p> <p># **Lightning Talks**</p> <p>## **1.** [TweetNLP](<a href=\"https://github.com/cardiffnlp/tweetnlp\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/cardiffnlp/tweetnlp</a>) \\- Asahi Ushio</p> <p>Language models have been widely used in many natural language processing (NLP) applications, but they do not perform well on social media due to the noisiness and temporal nature. In this talk, we will shortly describe our studies of NLP on social media, and introduce TweetNLP, a python library to facilitate the use of NLP tools tailored to social media.</p> <p>## 2\\.
