Initial attempts using off-the-shelf models like TextBlob and Bert were not accurate enough due to the unique language in the gaming domain.<br/>Holding onto my academic mindset, I contemplated creating a bespoke sentiment classifier, only to discover the lack of clean, labelled data specific to my domain\u2014a stark contrast to academic settings. My next step was to ask colleagues at my workplace to label some data, but as they are not data scientists they did not understand the aim and importance of this leading to poorly labelled data.<br/>Ultimately, rather than building a tool from scratch, the solution lay in fine-tuning existing models from Hugging Face, augmenting data with synthetic inputs from LLMs, and capitalising on few-shot classification to address data limitations.<br/>I believe that early-career data-scientists will benefit from this talk. It provides insights into the practical application of data science and NLP in a business context, highlighting the emphasis on speed and efficiency, as opposed to the academic focus on achieving the highest accuracy in a model.</p> <p># **2.** Slient Intrusion - How LLM Infiltrating Enterprises - Manish Sharma</p> <p>This talk tries to cover the how LLM are becoming need of enterprise but really are enterprises ready for it.</p> <p>**Lightning Talks**</p> <p># **1.** TBD</p> <p># **2.** TBD</p> <p>\ud83d\udd56 **LOGISTICS**<br/>Talks kick off at **18:30** sharp; then networking in The Knights Templar from **20:40.**<br/>**If you realise you can't make it**, please un-RSVP in good time to free up your place for your fellow community members.<br/>Follow @pydatabristol (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/pydatabristol\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/pydatabristol</a>) for updates on this and future events, as well as news from the global PyData community.</p> <p>\ud83d\udcdc **CODE OF CONDUCT**<br/>The PyData Code of Conduct governs this meetup (<a href=\"https://pydata.org/code-of-conduct/\" class=\"linkified\">https://pydata.org/code-of-conduct/</a>).
