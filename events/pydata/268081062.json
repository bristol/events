We will focus on pandas, a powerful and easy to use tool for data analysis and manipulation. You will learn how to load data, drill down and segment, aggregate up, pivot, visualise and write it out again.</p> <p>\ud83d\udcca TALKS<br/>=========</p> <p>1. Levi Wolf on \"PySal\"<br/>Description coming soon!</p> <p>Levi is a geographic methodologist, focusing primarily on Bayesian spatial econometrics &amp; psephology.<br/>He did his doctoral training in the southwest United States and is now an American expat living and working in Bristol. His dissertation focused on the process of gerrymandering, manipulation of electoral boundaries in pursuit of political advantage, which was awarded a National Science Foundation (NSF) Doctoral Dissertation Enhancement Grant.<br/>Levi also consulted for startups in San Francisco and Brooklyn as a spatial data scientist, statistician, and data engineer. He is a political believer in free and open source software and works mainly in Python and Julia. He serves as co-maintainer of the Python Spatial Analysis Library, and lead author of Python cyberinfrastructure in geovisualization, exploratory data analysis, and Bayesian statistical modeling.<br/>Levi now works at University of Bristol as Senior Lecturer in Quantitative Human Geography and is continuing to improve and develop methods for spatial social modeling, statistical analysis, and spatial data science.</p> <p>2. Chris Mussel on \"Agile and DevOps for Data Scientists\"</p> <p>This presentation is a crash course in what I've learnt from exploring the concepts of Agile Software Development and DevOps, and I'll aim to explain how each can help enhance a Data Science Team to develop and deploy quicker and more reliably, and ultimately spend more time doing Data Science!</p> <p>Chris is a former academic with a background in Chemistry and Computer Science from the University of Bristol, and has been working in data science/engineering for the last 10 years. He is passionate about Python, life long learning, solving problems, and building things that add value for others. And he is currently working as a Data Scientist at Malvern Panalytical, who are a leading provider of scientific instrumentation for the measurement of various chemical and elemental properties.</p> <p>\u26a1\ufe0f LIGHTNING TALKS<br/>=====================</p> <p>1.
