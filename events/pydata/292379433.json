A Random Walk Down GPT Street**<br/>===</p> <p>By the time you've finished reading this abstract, this talk will already be out of date. This is a light-hearted exploration of the ever-accelerating LLM landscape. It seeks to understand what's happening in the space, the various open-source projects available and how you might be able to use it at work or in your life as a practical data scientist or analyst. And if you're feeling really brave how-to run your own GPT from the comfort of your laptop.</p> <p># **2.** Mastering Machine Learning Techniques for Time-Series Analysis</p> <p>Dive into the vast and ever-evolving Python time-series ecosystem with this comprehensive talk designed to help you navigate and harness the power of cutting-edge libraries and models for time-series analysis. Ben Auffarth, a renowned expert and author, will guide you through this engaging and insightful journey.</p> <p>Beginning with an overview of essential time-series concepts, the talk will transition into a deep dive into training statistical time-series models and modern machine learning techniques. You'll gain hands-on experience with deep learning, gradient boosting models, and other advanced machine learning approaches, becoming confident in their practical application.</p> <p>Throughout the talk, Ben will share valuable tips and best practices to ensure you're well-equipped to tackle real-world time-series challenges. By the end, you'll feel empowered to effectively analyze and apply machine learning methods to time-series data, unlocking new possibilities and insights in your work.</p> <p>**LIGHTNING TALKS**<br/>===</p> <p>**3\\.
