Fill out this form to submit your talk proposal: [<a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/8lsz1WA1986Ahbbs1](https://goo.gl/forms/8lsz1WA1986Ahbbs1\" class=\"linkified\">https://goo.gl/forms/8lsz1WA1986Ahbbs1](https://goo.gl/forms/8lsz1WA1986Ahbbs1</a>)<br/>We look forward to seeing you there for another fantastic evening of Python, Data Science, and camaraderie!</p> <p>**Talks**</p> <p>**1.** Introduction to DBT - James Yarrow<br/>===</p> <p>DBT or Data Build Tools is a python library with a huge open source community and so much more. DBT focuses on the Transformation in ELT and is used by analytics engineers, data engineers and data scientist. It can be used to managed models in SQL server with great python extensibility and governance features.</p> <p>**2.** Inviting diversity when hiring for data jobs - Dr Elena Hensinger-Schien<br/>===</p> <p>When looking to build a diverse team, the job description, the interview task and the overall communication experience can be either inviting or off-putting for candidates. This talk will share some best practice, such as inclusive language and a critical assessment of our interview goal and approach, that will be beneficial not only to candidates from underrepresented groups within data, but all candidates.</p> <p>**Lightning Talks**</p> <p># **1.** Signal Processing with CNN - Michael Roberts</p> <p>This talk will give a brief overview of a method to apply Convolutional Neural Networks to analysis of audio data through the use of the Discrete Fourier Transform. This approach is used in the current state-of-the-art algorithm for musical segment boundary detection, the subject of my MSc thesis.</p> <p># **2.** Managing a million tiles to (sort of) cure cancer - James Leech</p> <p>Medical computer vision is complicated because biopsy scans are huge. Think of it as a satellite map analysis tool, where you are trying to read the road marking to determine what country you\u2019re in. It\u2019s a subclass of image analysis called multiple instance learning. In this lightning talk I want to introduce the specific challenges associated with medical computer vision, some solutions I\u2019ve learned thus far, and some gaps in current technology you could fill to make yourself rich.</p> <p>\ud83d\udd56 **LOGISTICS**<br/>Talks kick off at **18:30** sharp; then networking in The Knights Templar from **20:40.**<br/>**If you realise you can't make it**, please un-RSVP in good time to free up your place for your fellow community members.<br/>Follow @pydatabristol (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/pydatabristol\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/pydatabristol</a>) for updates on this and future events, as well as news from the global PyData community.</p> <p>\ud83d\udcdc **CODE OF CONDUCT**<br/>The PyData Code of Conduct governs this meetup (<a href=\"https://pydata.org/code-of-conduct/\" class=\"linkified\">https://pydata.org/code-of-conduct/</a>).
