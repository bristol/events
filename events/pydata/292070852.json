Building a Public-Facing and Low-Maintenance Wordle Solver with Unsupervised Learning<br/>===</p> <p>Wordle is a popular online game that challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries. While most Wordle solvers use supervised learning techniques to target specific word lists, this talk will explore a different approach. Join Jason Chao on his journey of building a public-facing Wordle Solver using unsupervised learning. He will showcase the possibility of rapidly developing a low-maintenance and future-proof side project.<br/>Despite time constraints, Jason built a Wordle Solver that works with multiple Wordle versions and supports variable word lengths. He will discuss how unsupervised learning helped him create a more robust and versatile solver. Additionally, he will share his experience of running the solver with almost zero maintenance and at a low operating cost.</p> <p>###Speaker bio:<br/>Jason Chao is a software engineer based in Bristol, UK. He has a passion for building products that solve real-world problems. Jason is experienced in Python, Django, and React, and has a strong interest in machine learning and data science. In his spare time, he enjoys participating in hackathons and building side projects. You can find out more about Jason on his website <a href=\"https://jasontc.net/\" class=\"linkified\">https://jasontc.net/</a> and follow him on Github at <a href=\"https://github.com/jason-chao\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/jason-chao</a>.</p> <p># ##2.

Software to Data: Lessons from a Crash Landing by Tom Foster<br/>===</p> <p>Moving from software development to data engineering can be a challenging transition, especially when it comes to landing your first data project. In this lightning talk, Tom Foster shares his personal journey from software to data, the key concepts he found useful to know before diving into data engineering, and the lessons he learned along the way. Tom also discusses his experience working on a PySpark and Databricks project, providing insights and tips that may be helpful to others making a similar transition.</p> <p>###Speaker bio:<br/>[Tom Foster](<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-f-60610887/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-f-60610887/</a>) is a data engineer with a background in full-stack software development.
