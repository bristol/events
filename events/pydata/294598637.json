They carry great potential to improve multi-agency work and help develop better crime prevention strategies. However, the lack of centralised access and the constant growth of the collection, make the manual analysis of the reports unfeasible. Therefore, we collaborated with the Crime and Security Research Institute (CSRI) at Cardiff University and Welsh Government for the creation of a Wales Safeguarding Repository (WSR) ([<a href=\"https://www.gov.wales/single-unified-safeguarding-review-guidance#116873](https://www.gov.wales/single-unified-safeguarding-review-guidance#116873\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.gov.wales/single-unified-safeguarding-review-guidance#116873](https://www.gov.wales/single-unified-safeguarding-review-guidance#116873</a>)) for providing a centralised access to the safeguarding reports and means for automatic information extraction. The aim of the repository is to facilitate efficient searchability of the collection and thus help free up resources and assist practitioners from health and social care agencies in making faster and more accurate decisions. It is an inter-disciplinary project involving expertise from computer science and social science where the social scientists are working on creating a robust thematic framework which helps identify key themes and problems which appear across the reviews. The computer science team is responsible for developing the repository infrastructure and also for developing automated tools which facilitate more efficient, faster, and easier searchability through the collection of reviews in order to support work of researchers and practitioners. Our research work on using text generation-based data augmentation techniques (presented in the paper: 'Guiding generative language models for data augmentation in few-shot text classification' at DASH workshop at EMNLP conference) showed that incorporating experts\\` knowledge into classification and augmentation techniques proved beneficial for the improvement of automated supervised methods for specialised domains such as the safeguarding reports.</p> <p>**2.** TBC<br/>===</p> <p>**Lightning Talks**</p> <p># **1.** TBC</p> <p># **2.** TBC</p> <p>\ud83d\udd56 **LOGISTICS**<br/>Talks kick off at **18:30** sharp; then networking in The Knights Templar from **20:40.**<br/>**If you realise you can't make it**, please un-RSVP in good time to free up your place for your fellow community members.<br/>Follow @pydatabristol (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/pydatabristol\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/pydatabristol</a>) for updates on this and future events, as well as news from the global PyData community.</p> <p>\ud83d\udcdc **CODE OF CONDUCT**<br/>The PyData Code of Conduct governs this meetup (<a href=\"https://pydata.org/code-of-conduct/\" class=\"linkified\">https://pydata.org/code-of-conduct/</a>).
