I will run through the project and try and answer questions I was curious about when I started it: how computers \u2018see\u2019 and what makes deep learning good for computer vision problems? How much data is enough and what makes a good dataset? What is transfer learning and how can I apply it my model? And, how do you train and test a deep learning model?<br/>I will also cover my implementations using PyTorch (an open source deep learning library developed by Facebook), lessons learned from the project and next steps.</p> <p>Dan is a senior consultant at Altran Digital, with a background in the aerospace and defence sector. He is a relative newcomer to coding, machine learning, and parenting.</p> <p>=======================================================================</p> <p>MEDIUM-SIZED TALKS</p> <p>1. Samantha North on \u201cTribalism and political misinformation on Twitter\u201d<br/>In this lightning talk, I will introduce my PhD research in progress, in which I use data science approaches in Python to understand social and political behaviour. Specifically, I\u2019m interested in how tribalism online might affect the spread of political misinformation topics related to the EU referendum.</p> <p>Samantha North is a PhD candidate in computational social science at the University of Bath. Before starting her PhD, she worked as a freelance journalist in the Middle East and studied Mandarin in China, picking up some Python along the way.</p> <p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p> <p>2.
