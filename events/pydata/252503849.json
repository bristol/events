I will discuss the extent to which software and robots already pass criteria for consciousness, and argue that this idea is a bad one, not (as some sci-fi suggests) because conscious code may become destructive, but because malware may be programmed to fake consciousness.<br/><a href=\"http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/people/miranda-j-mowbray/index.html\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/people/miranda-j-mowbray/index.html</a></p> <p>Miranda Mowbray is a lecturer in Computer Science at the University of Bristol, where her research interests include cyber security and big data ethics. Most of her career has been in industrial research, at HP. Her PhD is in Mathematics, from London University.

However, in order to demonstrate value from the analytics we do, we have to be able to deliver reliably. This often takes the form of either a reproducible research report/project, or in the form of a built prototype that developers/stakeholders can further experiment with. Testing is a fundamental component to any good software project, though unfortunately is often a bit of an afterthought in the Data Science world. This talk aims to motivate more Data Scientists to embrace testing in order to deliver more reliable analytic outputs.</p> <p>\u26a1\ufe0f LIGHTNING TALKS<br/>=====================</p> <p>1.<br/>Jaunius Urbonas on \"Brief introduction to the application of PCA in Data Science\"</p> <p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br/>2.<br/>Margriet Groenendijk on \"Call for Code: Innovation and Technology for Good\"<br/><a href=\"https://callforcode.org/\" class=\"linkified\">https://callforcode.org/</a><br/><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/margrietgroenendijk/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/margrietgroenendijk/</a></p> <p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br/>3.<br/>TBC</p> <p>\ud83d\udd56 LOGISTICS<br/>==============</p> <p>Doors open at 18:30, talks kick off at 19:00 sharp, beers from 21:00.
