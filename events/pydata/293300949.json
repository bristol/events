Not only did that not happen, but even the name \u201cAutoML\u201d has become sullied along with the myth of the citizen data scientist. In this talk, Greg will discuss the launch of a brand new open source project that promises to deliver AutoML as it should have been: open, flexible, code-based, and targeted at the only people generating value from machine learning \u2014 data science experts.</p> <p># **2.** Building online learners with RiverML - Anna Andersson</p> <p>Anna found themselves working on a project with very little data available for training. As the anticipated data was going to be a stream, one of the approaches they explored was to build an online learner or stream learner that would give the models a chance to improve as they were exposed to data from the actual process. Building the online learner models, they had to take a different approach to my entire workflow. Here, they will share what they learnt about working with models that improve over time, how to evaluate them, deal with drift and how to use multi-armed bandits for model selection.</p> <p>**3.** Cooking up a new search system: Inside recipe search at Cookpad - Matt Williams<br/>===</p> <p>Cookpad's recipe search helps cooks everywhere find tasty dishes to cook within an ever-growing catalogue of six million recipes created by everyday cooks. As a global recipe search with over 40m monthly users \u2013 optimising search quality is a critical and challenging task. Over the course of 2 years, the team embarked on a technological and cultural transition, with the aim of giving engineers greater ownership of the search experience. This included a shift to a Python-based stack and a data-driven approach to experimentation. This talk will give a brief intro to search relevance, and cover Cookpad Global's search journey, along with the trials, tribulations, and successes along the way.</p> <p>\ud83d\udd56 **LOGISTICS**<br/>Talks kick off at **18:30** sharp; then networking in The Knights Templar from **20:40.**<br/>**If you realise you can't make it**, please un-RSVP in good time to free up your place for your fellow community members.<br/>Follow @pydatabristol (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/pydatabristol\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/pydatabristol</a>) for updates on this and future events, as well as news from the global PyData community.</p> <p>\ud83d\udcdc **CODE OF CONDUCT**<br/>The PyData Code of Conduct governs this meetup (<a href=\"https://pydata.org/code-of-conduct/\" class=\"linkified\">https://pydata.org/code-of-conduct/</a>).
