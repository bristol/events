Not only did that not happen, but even the name \u201cAutoML\u201d has become sullied along with the myth of the citizen data scientist. In this talk, Greg will discuss the launch of a brand new open source project that promises to deliver AutoML as it should have been: open, flexible, code-based, and targeted at the only people generating value from machine learning \u2014 data science experts.</p> <p>Bio: Greg Michaelson is Cofounder and Chief Product Officer at Zerve, a young, stealthy startup that\u2019s rethinking the data science development experience. Previously, Greg was an early joiner at DataRobot where he played many roles, including Chief Customer Officer. Prior to that, he worked as a data scientist in the financial sector after earning a PhD in applied statistics from the University of Alabama. In his spare time, Greg manufactures a line of flavored breakfast cereal toppings called Cerup. He lives in Spring Creek, Nevada with his wife, four children, and two Clumber Spaniels.</p> <p># **2.** **TBC**</p> <p>**LIGHTNING TALKS**<br/>===</p> <p>**3\\. TBC**<br/>===</p> <p># **4\\.
