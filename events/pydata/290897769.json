Reinforcement learning: theory and applications by Peter Marinov\\.<br/>===========================<br/>Reinforcement learning is a powerful framework for teaching computational agents how to make decisions based on a reward-based system. In this talk, we will explore the fundamental algorithmic principles behind the approach and see it applied to a 2D world problem, where an agent learns to navigate an icy lake with holes and cross safely to the other side.</p> <p>Speaker bio:<br/>Peter Marinov is a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with a background in Physics and Computer Science. He holds a Master's degree in Computer Science, with a focus on Medical Imaging, Machine Learning, and Modelling of the cardiovascular system. Peter is currently the Lead Data Scientist for Measmerize, an online digital fitting room, and has previously worked as a Machine Learning Engineer for Fundamentals, building intelligent systems for the electric power grid. Peter is passionate about Reinforcement Learning and its applications and has hands-on experience developing and deploying RL models in various domains.</p> <p>2\\. TBC</p> <p>\\# LIGHTNING TALKS<br/>3\\. Tracking Korfball Players Using Computer Vision and Machine Learning by Andrew Bovey\\.<br/>===========================<br/>In this lightning talk, Andrew Bovey will discuss his exploratory work in applying computer vision techniques and machine learning methods to track korfball players from match footage. Using Detectron2's implementation of Instance Segmentation, the talk will showcase how players can be detected, and their position can be estimated, classified, and tracked as they move across the court.<br/>Speaker bio:<br/>Andrew Bovey is a Data Scientist and recent graduate of the University of Exeter's Masters in Data Science with Artificial Intelligence program. His interest in sports analytics, specifically in the application of data science and machine learning techniques in Korfball, led him to work on a dissertation project that explored tracking players from match footage.<br/>Andrew has experience hosting meetups and is currently setting up **PyData Exeter**, where he's looking for co-organizers, speakers, venues, and sponsors. With a passion for teaching, Andrew has previously hosted internal company meetups focused on Python programming and data science and has been involved with the Data Science for IoT Meetup.<br/>You can connect with Andrew on LinkedIn at <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewjbovey/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewjbovey/</a>.</p> <p>\\# \ud83d\udd56 LOGISTICS<br/>Talks kick off at 18:30 sharp; then networking/beers in The Knights Templar from 20:40.<br/>If you realise you can't make it, please un-RSVP in good time to free up your place for your fellow community members.<br/>Follow @pydatabristol (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/pydatabristol\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/pydatabristol</a>) for updates on this and future events, as well as news from the global PyData community.<br/>\\# \ud83d\udcdc CODE OF CONDUCT<br/>The PyData Code of Conduct governs this meetup (<a href=\"https://pydata.org/code-of-conduct/\" class=\"linkified\">https://pydata.org/code-of-conduct/</a>).
