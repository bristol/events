Anne Koopman on \"Sleep on it: Evaluating the effect of sleep on creativity with Python &amp; R\"</p> <p>-When we're struggling with a difficult problem, we may be advised to 'sleep on it'. Indeed, anecdotal evidence and some studies suggest that sleep promotes creativity and problem solving.<br/>-In this talk I discuss one of my experiments, which compared (change in) creative production after a night of sleep versus a day of wakefulness. I'll also talk a bit about the use of open source programming methods in my field.<br/>-The experimental tasks I used were written in Python with PsychoPy, an open source software package that makes building experiments really easy. The data were analysed with R, so I'll have some snazzy graphs to show you as well!</p> <p>Anne is finishing up her PhD at Cardiff University, where she looks at the effect of sleep on memory and creativity.</p> <p>2. David Greenwood on \"The Many Factors of Santa: A festive use for Bayesian Variational Auto-Encoder)\"</p> <p>-Understand why and how to combine Deep Learning and Bayesian methods<br/>-Learn how-to generate images with VAE (Variational Encoders)<br/>-Learn about how-to implement them in Python using Keras using a pictures of Santa (rather than the the NIST dataset or cats).</p> <p>David is the Director of Data Science for CheckRisk where he specialises in the use of data science to provide forward looking risk models that enable smart risk taking.</p> <p>\u26a1\ufe0f LIGHTNING TALKS<br/>=====================</p> <p>1.
