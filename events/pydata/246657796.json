    "description": "<p>We are delighted to announce the very first PyData meetup in Bristol!</p> <p>This launch social will be an informal get together to meet local Pythonistas and data minded folk in a relaxed atmosphere. We would especially like to meet anyone interested in contributing a talk (or a five-minute lightning talk) in the coming months. Everyone welcome regardless of experience, and it will hopefully be a good opportunity to do some networking and have a general chat over a couple of drinks.</p> <p>We currently plan to hold PyData Bristol every other month, on the third Thursday of each month, as follows:<br/>\u2022 Thu 15th Feb 2018 \u2013 Launch &amp; Social<br/>\u2022 Thu 15th Mar 2018 \u2013 Speakers TBC<br/>\u2022 Thu 17th May 2018 - Speakers TBC<br/>\u2022 Thu 19th July 2018 - Speakers TBC<br/>\u2022 ...etc...</p> ",
