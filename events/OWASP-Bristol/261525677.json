This is mostly due to an inherent lack of communication and understanding from both development and security sides. As security professionals, we expect an easy and open collaboration, but developers tend to see any interaction with us as an interruption in their day to day activities. Based on my experience as a software developer and currently as an Application Security specialist, I see this miscommunication as the source of the biggest breaches in modern history, leading to the loss of not only valuable customer and financial data, but also to companies\u2019 status and reputation. This talk is a collection of \u201clife\u201d hacks and ideas from my time as a developer and as a security professional. It aims to convince developers to start thinking like attackers and build software defensively, as well as provide various suggestions to security professionals to help them understand the development area and how best to communicate the importance of security at every step of the software lifecycle.</p> <p>Bio: Andra is an Application Security Specialist at Worldpay, OWASP London Chapter Leader, and a co-founders of the OWASP Women in AppSec (WIA) Chapter in London. She comes from a Software Development background and has a wealth of experience in application security and threat modelling, risk management and security testing. She works with development teams on improving their security awareness and finding ways to integrate and customise security practices at every point in their design and development processes.</p> <p>Presentation 2: Stranger Danger: Finding Security Vulnerabilities Before They Find You!</p> <p>Abstract: Open source modules on the NPM ecosystem are undoubtedly awesome. However, they also represent an undeniable and massive risk. You\u2019re introducing someone else\u2019s code into your system, often with little or no scrutiny. The wrong package can introduce severe vulnerabilities into your application, exposing your application and your user\u2019s data. This talk will use a sample application, Goof, which uses various vulnerable dependencies, which we will exploit as an attacker would. For each issue, we\u2019ll explain why it happened, show its impact, and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 see how to avoid or fix it.</p> <p>Bio: Siobh\u00e1n is a Software Engineer at Snyk. Snyk enables you to find and fix known vulnerabilities in your third-party dependencies via the CLI or web interface. Siobh\u00e1n works on their growth team building tools to make Snyk more effective. She recently moved to Bristol from South Africa and has worked remotely since completing her studies in Computer Science, Psychology and Games Development at the University of Cape Town.</p> ",
