I will discuss technical details and explain the different use cases that might benefit you, from blue team using Sysmon and Cilium/Tetragon to achieve super powerful abilities, to researchers building custom program tracers, to red team exploiting kernel vulns, to sysadmins seeking performance issues.</p> <p>It is a truly exciting thing that everyone is talking about.</p> <p>Bio: Kev Sheldrake is a security software engineer and researcher who started working in the technical security field in 1997. Over the years, Kev has been a developer and systems administrator of \u2018secure\u2019 systems, an infosec policy consultant, a penetration tester, a reverse engineer and an entrepreneur who founded and ran his own security consulting company. He currently works at Isovalent on the open source and enterprise versions of the system observability tool Tetragon, and in the past he specialised in IoT, crypto, and tool development for a number of years.<br/>Twitter: [@kevsecurity](<a href=\"https://twitter.com/kevsecurity\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/kevsecurity</a>)</p> <p>The meeting will be streamed viaYouTube at:</p> <p>[<a href=\"https://youtu.be/zlfXLdfe47I](https://youtu.be/zlfXLdfe47I\" class=\"embedded\">https://youtu.be/zlfXLdfe47I](https://youtu.be/zlfXLdfe47I</a>)</p> ",
