While extensions can be very useful, they come with hidden dangers \u2013 users often prioritise functionality over safety. In this talk, you'll uncover the real risks of using extensions, explore common attacks, and learn about pitfalls. You'll also take a look at some real-life security incidents and what went wrong. You'll leave with a deeper understanding of the need for browser extension security and how to safeguard your browser.</p> <p>**Bio:** Billy Sheppard is a Bristol-based Senior Application Security Engineer working at Immersive Labs where he creates Secure Code content and challenges for their product.</p> <p>In his career thus far, he has earned several achievements including VDP submissions for Fortune 500 companies, Bug bounties, and created and released his own niche CTF/Hacking challenge specifically aimed at increasing security awareness for ServiceNow developers.
