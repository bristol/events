We will discuss multiple languages and their advantages whilst focussing on interacting with the HTTP protocol.</p> <p>The key learning points from this talk are as follows:</p> <p>* To gain an understanding of the importance of scripting for application security testers.<br/>* What programming languages are used, and their advantages/disadvantages.<br/>* Typical scenarios where scripting is required because tooling is not comprehensive enough.</p> <p>**Bio**: Alex is head of professional services &amp; a senior consultant at Pentest People. He has a wealth of experience in penetration testing, people management and training hackers. He believes that all application security professionals should be able to write basic scripts to solve common problems.</p> ",
