Those websites help businesses operate on a daily basis (invoices, diaries, reports, etc), and operate with Security, Performance, and Accessibility in mind. From a security point of view, I created the first website to gain 130 points on the Mozilla Observatory.</p> <p><b>Presentation 2:</b>\u00a0\"A short introduction to Threat Modelling</p> <p><b>Abstract:\u00a0</b>This short introduction will provide an overview of threat\u00a0modelling\u00a0used in Secure Development Lifecycles, and covers:</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0Threat Models</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0The tools used to create them</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0Why they are useful</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0Open source Threat Dragon</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0How to get involved</p> <p><b>Bio:\u00a0</b>Jon is an embedded C/C++ engineer who specialises in product security and secure development lifecycle activities. For the last few years he has been a security advocate at Cisco, a role which requires interest and knowledge of secure development along with a hefty dose of tact. Jon tends to enjoy threat modeling more than static analysis, and penetration testing more than security baselines ... but it is all good.\u00a0</p> <p>In his spare time he likes to help organise security conferences and contribute to open source projects - the latest being the OWASP Threat Dragon modelling tool.</p> ",
