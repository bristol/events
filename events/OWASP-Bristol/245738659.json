This talk describes the more common schemes together with the more common mistakes made, and shows how to crack passwords of several popular formats if the hash should be obtained. In particular, we cover hashcat, plus John the Ripper as well as hardware acceleration.\"</p> <p>Bio: \"Jamie Riden has been a developer, a sysadmin, security engineer and is now a penetration tester, doing a mix of infrastructure and web applications. He has interests in phishing and password cracking, and has an Erd\u0151s number of 4.\"</p> <p>Presentation 2: The Security of Blockchain Abstract: This presentation will cover the fundamental of<br/>a.
