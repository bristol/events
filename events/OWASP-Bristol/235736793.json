How can device identities or attributes be authenticated?\u00a0What are the current approaches, derived from fixed network infrastructure, and their strengths and weaknesses in IoT?<br/>2.\u00a0<b>Privacy</b>.\u00a0What is the potential for IoT devices to make more information available about individuals\u2019 movements, behaviour and preferences?\u00a0How can such information be controlled or restricted? Is there opportunity for \u2018adware\u2019 with IoT devices \u2013 specific tracking features placed by third parties?Will sensor diversity inevitably allow the linkage of distributed information?</p> <p>3. <b>Communications</b>\u00a0.\u00a0What limitations on communication protocols result from the types of device?\u00a0some contrasting approaches to communication (including ad-hoc networks) and review of their capability, their suitability for different types of device and the feasibility of providing integrity, availability, and confidentiality. Contrast the security solutions with those available for fixed internet network infrastructure.</p> <p>4 <b>Attacks</b>.\u00a0What is already known about real attacks on, or using, IoT devices?Do these attacks suggest general trends or threats against a wider range of IoT devices?\u00a0Do these attacks suggest that existing solutions can be applied to IoT, or are there new problems that require new solutions?<br/><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>Bio</b>:\u00a0Ramesh Krishnasagar is a\u00a0Cyber Security Consultant at Cisco\u00a0 with experience in design, development, integration and testing of embedded system software for major clients.</p> <p><b>Presentation 2</b>:\u00a0\"Securing Financial APIs -&gt; moving beyond vanilla OAuth\".</p> <p><b>Abstract</b>: OAuth 2.0 the least bad option for banking APIs.\u00a0There is a lot of FUD spread around OAuth 2 and OpenID Connect, in this talk I'll dispel some of the myths, show how the standards are being adapted to support Open Banking and paint a picture of the future that doesn't involve creating a new password for every new service!</p> <p><b>Bio</b>:\u00a0Dave is the CTO of Moneyhub Enterprise, a member of the Open ID Foundation working on open standards for financial APIs and is the\u00a0technical representative for the Financial Data and Technology Association.\u00a0</p> ",
