We will have some prizes to hand out for winners of the tournament.</p> <p>\"King of the Hill (KoTH) is a competitive hacking game, where you play against 10 other hackers to compromise a machine and then patch its vulnerabilities to stop other players from also gaining access. The longer you maintain your access, the more points you get.\"</p> <p>In order to take part, you will need to have a TryHackMe account, no subscription required.</p> <p>For a full list of event pre-requisites, take a look at the OWASP Dorset website: [<a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-chapter-dorset/#div-kingofthehill](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-dorset/#div-kingofthehill\" class=\"linkified\">https://owasp.org/www-chapter-dorset/#div-kingofthehill](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-dorset/#div-kingofthehill</a>)<br/>We look forward to seeing you all there!</p> ",
