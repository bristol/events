An experimental journey through device access, cloud storage, serverless functions, and a public website. With an insight into problem-solving changes necessary to bring the code cross-platform to run on Linux on a Raspberry Pi. Later in the talk, we will look at motion detection and image recognition. A light hearted look through a project that evolved fluidly, with no set plan, open sourced and at low cost.</p> <p>We'll be hosted by the lovely folks at iO associates who will be providing refreshments - look forward to seeing you there!</p> ",
