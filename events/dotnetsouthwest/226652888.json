In maintaining the data breach notification service \"Have I been pwned?\", I've dealt with literally hundreds of millions of breached records over time and have seen some fascinating things. In this talk we'll look at the patterns organisations who suffered data breaches were using, the types of data that were exposed and the things they could have done to protect themselves from malicious actors.</p> <p><b>Bio:</b>\u00a0I'm Troy Hunt, an Australian\u00a0<a href=\"http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/overview.aspx\">Microsoft Most Valuable Professional</a>\u00a0for Developer Security. I don't work for Microsoft, but they're kind enough to recognise my community contributions by way of their MVP program which I've been an awardee of since 2011. I get to interact with some fantastic people building their best products and then share what I know about creating secure applications for the web with the broader community. <a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/p/about.html\">Read More!</a></p> ",
