But many of them propagated misunderstandings of Kent's original rules so that TDD practice bears little resemblance to Kent's original ideas. Key misunderstandings around what do I test, what is a unit test, and what is the 'public interface' have led to test suites that are brittle, hard to read, and do not support easy refactoring. In this talk we re-discover Kent's original proposition, discover where key misunderstandings occurred and look at a better approach to TDD that supports software development instead of impeding it. Be prepared from some sacred cows to be slaughtered and fewer but better tests to be written.</p> <p>The Speaker<br/>Ian Cooper has over 20 years of experience delivering Microsoft platform solutions in government, healthcare, and finance. During that time he has worked for the DTi, Reuters, Sungard, Misys, Beazley and Huddle delivering everything from bespoke enterprise solutions to 'shrink-wrapped' products to thousands of customers. Ian is a passionate exponent of OO, SOA, EDA, CQRS and Agile. When he is not writing C# code he is also the and founder of the London .NET user group.</p> <p>You can read his blog at codebetter.com/iancooper and catch him on Twitter at @ICooper.</p> <p>Thanks</p> ",
