We tend to shy away from Web UI testing as the feedback loop is just too slow. In this presentation we will look at a toolset that gives us both end-to-end testing that aims to give us far faster feedback. \u00a0</p> <p>Welcome to the CasperJS a navigation and testing utility written in JavaScript, which plays nicely alongside PhantomJs, a headless WebKit browser.</p> <p>Bio:\u00a0Richard started programming during the home computing era with a ZX81.
