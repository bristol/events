Don\u2019t make it easy for them and the baddies will move on and find someone else to annoy.</p> <p>We\u2019ll look at the risks facing web applications, the basic steps you can take so that you don\u2019t make yourself a target and the things you should do to avoid becoming a data breach statistic. We\u2019ll also look at lessons that can be learnt from mistakes that others have made.</p> <p>We\u2019ll demo some of the techniques and tools in both attack and defence with examples for any web application developer.</p> <p>About Robin:</p> <p>Robin is a developer/technical architect working for ByBox, a supply chain technology company in the UK.</p> <p>He\u2019s passionate about development, continuous improvement and all things security (he's a Certified Ethical Hacker). With one foot in Dev and another in Ops, he\u2019s as happy in C# as in PowerShell, in Visual Studio or Hyper-V, in Javascript or Docker.</p> <p>Other passions include snowboarding, cycling and gin (but not together).
