We will discuss the advantages of serverless computing, including reduced costs, simplified deployment, and increased scalability. We will also cover how to use AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, and other AWS services to build serverless applications.</p> <p>You will learn how to develop, test, and deploy serverless applications using .NET. By the end of this talk, you will have a solid understanding of how to build production ready, high performance serverless applications.</p> <p>We will be hosted in a new venue - excitingly its a new member of the community will be hosting us, and it's great to see the community expand.
