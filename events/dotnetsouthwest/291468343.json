This will take place on the 8th March at the Just Eat office (2nd floor - Broad Quay House).</p> <p>We will be kicking things off at 6:30pm with some pizza and beers/refreshments and aiming to start the talk at 7pm.</p> <p>**The talk**<br/>OpenTelemetry is the biggest project to come out of The Cloud Native Compute Foundation since a little thing they did called \"Kubernetes\", and it's become the De Facto Standard for exporting telemetry data from your application. So how do you implement it? is it hard?</p> <p>In this talk, we'll go through Tracing, Metrics, and Logs from a .NET perspective. I'll show how easy and simple it is to implement, and give you the heads up on the gotchas you might face.</p> ",
