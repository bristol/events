    "description": "<p>About the Talk:<br/>You probably know how to secure your API with access tokens, but did you know you can use reference tokens to improve security? The token exchange standard for delegated access? A custom grant for API to API access? And what about improving client authentication for those use cases where clientid &amp; client secret don't cut it anymore?</p> <p>In this in-depth session, we'll cover all of these topics, extensively using IdentityServer4 in the process. Note that some previous knowledge on OAuth2 and OpenID Connect is a must.</p> <p>About the Speaker:<br/>Kevin is a freelance solution architect, Pluralsight author &amp; consultant, living in Antwerp (Belgium). These days he's mainly focused on RESTful architectures &amp; application security.</p> <p>He's a Microsoft MVP, and a keen proponent of open-source software.</p> <p>Also: wine.</p> ",
