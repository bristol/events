We will be joined by Prasad Rao, Senior Partner Solutions Architect at Amazon Web Services, who will be speaking on \u2018Port That .Net Framework Application to .Net5\u2019.</p> <p>.NET 5 represents a new era within the .NET ecosystem. New development on the .NET Framework has ended, and while it is still a viable application framework, the writing is definitely on the wall as there is no reason that any new development projects would use the v4.x .NET Framework. Instead, they would most likely be on .NET 5 or .NET Core 3.1. This could end up with projects within a company being scattered across various development frameworks as your team manages both current applications and new systems.</p> <p>In this session, we will look at how to port your .NET Framework application. We will use the Porting Assistant for .NET (an open-source AWS-created application) to evaluate the level of effort needed to convert the applications as well as work through several of the most common porting issues and concerns.</p> <p>About the speaker<br/>Prasad Rao is a Senior Partner Solutions Architect for AWS based out of the UK. His focus areas are .NET Application Modernisation and Windows Workloads on AWS. He leverages his experience to help AWS Partners across EMEA for their long term technical enablement to build scalable architecture on AWS.
