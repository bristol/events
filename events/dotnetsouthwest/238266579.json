    "description": "<p>SonarQube has become the de-facto tool for assessing code quality.</p> <p>SonarQube runs rules, unit tests and code coverage against code, assesses code quality and calculates technical debt. SonarQube categorizes technical debt and provides clear indication of where the most important technical debt must be re-paid. Most importantly SonarQube tracks metrics over time and provides developers and managers with the statistics necessary to determine progress.</p> <p>This session demonstrates the key features of SonarQube from the perspective of C# analysis and shows the value of revealing your code\u2019s strengths and weaknesses.</p> <p><b>About Guy Smith-Ferrier:</b></p> <p>Guy is a software developer living in Bristol.
