Blazor is Microsoft\u2019s new front-end framework for building single page applications using C#, not JavaScript. That\u2019s right, C# running in your browser. No plugins, transpilation or voodoo magic involved - just web standards.</p> <p>In this talk, you'll learn all about this game changing platform and how it brings choice back into front-end development.</p> <p>Starting from the beginning, you'll explore Blazor's flexible architecture and it's different rendering modes. You'll learn how C# code is able to run in the browser via a technology called WebAssembly. You'll also cover Blazor's component model, syntax, project types and more.</p> <p>By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of what Blazor is and how it could be the last framework you'll ever need!</p> ",
