Perhaps you\u2019ve seen it mentioned in job ads, or had a play with it years ago in the .NET Framework days. It offers developers high flexibility, security and scalability whilst giving content editors an easy-to-use interface and intuitive editing experience. It\u2019s free and Open-Source, and supported by a community of friendly, highly-engaged developers.</p> <p>**If Carlsberg did .NET Content Management Systems** with Lotte Pitcher<br/>In this talk we shall learn what a .NET developer needs to know to get started with modern (.NET 8) Umbraco. We shall review its key features, including recently added ones such headless and EF core support, and where the product is heading in the future. Enough for you to determine if Umbraco is a good fit for current or upcoming projects, or if you want to extend your .NET skills and learn something new.</p> <p>Lotte Pitcher has been building websites for longer than she cares to remember, and has recently joined the Developer Relations team at Umbraco, She is a Microsoft MVP, a long-time open-source contributor and a passionate advocate for being an active member of a healthy, inclusive tech community.
