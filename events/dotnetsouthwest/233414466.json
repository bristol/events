With TypeScript 2.0 many of JavaScript\u2019s shortcomings are rectified, making writing functional code a joyous experience.</p> <p><b>About Mike Tinning:</b></p> <p>Mike is a Senior Developer at Scott Logic and has worked in Bristol for 7 years, having decided to stick around after graduating from the University of Bristol. He is passionate about sharing knowledge and building a software development community in the South West, and helps organise Bristech during his breaks from coding. His current obsession is functional programming, and he\u2019s desperate to talk about how awesome it is to anyone who will listen.</p> ",
