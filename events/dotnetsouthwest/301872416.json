While we have all tried and tested GitHub Copilot in our IDEs, let's look at how to use Copilot to make use more efficient and better developers. In this session, we're going to go beyond the usual tips and trips, look at how we can use GitHub Copilot to write test plans, create documentation and allow us to be more productive with the tasks that we love.</p> <p>**EDIT :**<br/>Due to the fantastic response to this event, we've found a bigger venue to host us, the excellent folks at Amdaris in central Bristol will be hosting us, and our co-sponsors IO will be providing refreshments - our thanks to all our sponsors, without whom we would not be able to host these events.</p> <p>As before, please make sure you RSVP if you can make it - Look forward to seeing you all there!</p> ",
