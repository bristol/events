In this talk, he will explain the different models that gRPC enables, from Request/Response to full bi-directional streaming, and how they map to various WCF models. He'll show how to create gRPC services and clients using the dotnet CLI, and share best practices for using them in the real world.</p> <p>Find out more and get signed up here: <a href=\"https://register.gotowebinar.com/register/5671327561173080077\" class=\"linkified\">https://register.gotowebinar.com/register/5671327561173080077</a></p> <p>iO can\u2019t wait to bring you this first (of many) Virtual Meetups and really welcome your feedback.
