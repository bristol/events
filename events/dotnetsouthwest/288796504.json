When we build .NET applications, we have a ton of options to how we build, what dependencies we leverage, and finally where we put those applications. We need to think about what app component model we use, like MVC, Blazor or Web API, and depending on that choice, it may dictate what platform we look to host our apps on.</p> <p>Whether you are building apps hosted on IIS or Kestrel (if you are fancy), leveraging containers, building serverless event-driven applications, to microservices, there are just tons of options out there. AWS provides services that provide options for all these modalities. Whether you are or are not familiar with AWS, this session will provide insight into how AWS is a great option for hosting all types of .NET Apps.</p> <p>**About the Author**: Isaac Levin is a .NET Developer Advocate at Amazon Web Services as well as a speaker and a Microsoft MVP living in Woodinville, WA.
