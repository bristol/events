    "description": "<p>Monolith applications are almost unheard of in today\u2019s world, with most applications talking between a host of servers \u2013 whether micro- or macro- for data and functionality. A wide range of service layers exist for this, but .NET Core 3 adds first-class support for gRPC, Google\u2019s preferred offering.</p> <p>In this session, Marc Gravell from Stack Overflow looks at how you can integrate gRPC between your applications \u2013 or to external gRPC resources \u2013 with efficiency and high performance, including new options for publishing and consuming gRPC services.</p> <p>About Marc</p> <p>Marc has been a remote developer for Stack Overflow since 2010 (and is somehow also still in the top 10 on the \u201cusers\u201d board), usually working on the back-end plumbing for tools like SQL Server or Redis, with a keen eye on high performance and scalability with a C# bias. He is the author/co-author of multiple popular .NET libraries such as \u201cStackExchange.Redis\u201d, \u201cDapper\u201d and \u201cProtobuf-net\u201d and an active member of the .NET open source community.</p> ",
