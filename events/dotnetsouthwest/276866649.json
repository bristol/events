Outside her work, Poornima enjoys music and is undergoing training in Indian Classical music. Based in Langley, UK she mothers a little girl and spends her spare time reading, cooking and watching movies.</p> <p>Poornima gives us some insight on her upcoming session:</p> <p>\u2018GraphQL is a cool kid on the block. It's a term that is gaining traction these days and the tech stack is getting quite popular. In my session, I will introduce GraphQL as a concept. From there on, we will look at how we can create a GraphQL service and consume that GraphQL service in a Blazor App\u2019</p> <p>The second half of this session will be led by Clare Sudbery, Lead Engineer:</p> <p>Clare is a lead consultant developer with Made Tech. She is a maths graduate with 20 years of software engineering experience, and a particular interest in teaching and mentoring; encouraging more women into IT, and banishing impostor syndrome. Seven years ago she returned to IT with a sigh of relief after a few years as a high school maths teacher. Since then she has embraced all things XP. She is on a mission to awaken the inner geek in clever women (and men) everywhere.</p> <p>In this session, Clare will be asking: Do you code on your own? When you do, do you write unit tests? Do you agree that there are benefits to using test-driven development?</p> <p>Cheers,</p> <p>Michael Collins - iO Associates</p> ",
