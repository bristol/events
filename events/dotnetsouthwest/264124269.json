Using F#, this session introduces the concept with plenty of examples and then shows how to transfer these ideas to a non-functional language like C#.</p> <p>About Ed Courtenay</p> <p>Ed is a Senior Developer at Just Eat. He started coding on the BBC Micro in the mid 80s and - barring a few years in the early 90s when labouring under the misapprehension that he could make a living as a musician - has continued to write code professionally until the present day.</p> ",
