Today we have cryptographic algorithms that our own government's security and intelligence organisations claim they can't crack. However, security breaches, compromised passwords, stolen credit card details, etc. feature in the news regularly, and the perpetrators aren't government experts, they're amateurs.</p> <p>Can you keep a secret? The anecdotal evidence would suggest the answer is a resounding no! In this talk I'll introduce you to some cryptographic principles and show how you can make use of them in .NET\u00a0and how they can be used correctly.</p> <p><b>Bio:</b>\u00a0Owain Williams is the Technical Lead of Giftcloud, a product backed by the creators of Vouchercloud.

He was part of the team that first started using the NHS data spine and helped shape the way encryption was used within it. He has also designed and implemented secure systems for several companies.</p> <p>Born in London, brought up in South Wales, now living with his wife in Bristol, Owain is a well-travelled man and enjoys weekend's away, cooking &amp; eating, loud shirts &amp; colourful trousers and is currently learning to fly light aircraft.</p> <p><b>--- TALK 2 ---</b></p> <p><b>Topic:</b>\u00a0Marco De Bortoli - Deploying\u00a0.NET with Vagrant &amp; Packer</p> <p><b>Description:</b>\u00a0Little projects like JustBakeIt are what happens when you take an engineer who stopped working with Microsoft technologies back when ASP was at its version 3.0 and you put him in front of the 21st century reality of Windows 2012 r2 and the new Enterprise world of the cloud computing. Debo will take us in a tour through the tools he used to make is \u201cnew\u201d life a bit easier than it was when he started the journey.</p> <p><b>Bio:\u00a0</b>Marco aka Debo is currently working for Just Eat as Senior Software Engineer, he is a\u2002 Zend PHP Certified Engineer and has over 14 years experience in different sectors of the IT industry.
