    "description": "<p>To end the year, we are holding a festive gathering for all ACCU Bristol members to get together and sociaise. If you have already been to a meeting and want to catch up with the people you met there, or if you haven't been to a meeting yet and just want to meet us and find out about ACCU and the local group, please come along. We're a friendly group, all are welcome.</p> <p>The plan is to keep it simple on the night, and meet for drinks and chat at our favourite post-meeting pub, the Cornubia (thecornubia.co.uk) on Temple St.</p> <p>Please RSVP if you are coming along, so we have a good idea of numbers.</p> ",
