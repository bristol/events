I suspect it is underused.</p> <p>To a C++ dev, compile time programming means templates and constexpr. To a python or javascript dev, compile time is at risk of being totally ignored. Some languages conflate it with type checking. While these are valid subsets of compile time, they hardly justify my opening claim.</p> <p>I intend to draw on examples from my work, my play and the wider world to show that compile time can be used for much more than this. In keeping with the current not-just-C++ leaning of the ACCU, I'll try to ensure that your favourite language is represented.</p> ",
