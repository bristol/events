    "description": "<p>This will be the last meeting before the main ACCU Conference, and I'm delighted to let you know that Christopher Harpum is giving a talk on Abstractions. So please do sign up, it promises to be an informative talk. After which we shall depart to a pub somewhere, could be Brewdog, could be somewhere else.</p> <p>Synopsis</p> <p>Over time, languages have grown and new programming paradigms have been developed. Accordingly, new abstractions are created to express a programmer\u2019s intent through syntax. However, what is the price we pay for this ease of use?</p> <p>Let's look at some of the fundamental building blocks that span the wide world of programming languages - Using C++ as example, we\u2019ll explore the evolution, missteps, points of contention, and what the future may hold.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>A glutton for punishment, Chris jumped into C++ early in his programming endeavour. Lunch breaks, after school and holidays each became opportunities to reinvent the wheel and learn more about the language.</p> <p>With so many nooks and crannies, finding new and interesting ways to use (and abuse) C++ has become a hobby that he loves to share (whether those unfortunate enough to inquire like it or not).</p> ",
