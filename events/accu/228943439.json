But they are put off the distorted 'Google or bust' image of starting your a software business portrayed by the media. I will discuss what it is really like to make a living selling your own software product online. I will be covering topics including:</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0how much money do you need to start your own business?</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0do you need a co-founder?</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0do you need employees?</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0how much red tape is involved in running a company?</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0how do you know if there is a market for your product?</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0choosing a platform: desktop, web or mobile?</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0how do you promote your product?</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0how painful is it to do support for non-technical people?</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0can you make more money than working for other people?</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0how do you take a holiday?</p> <p>I hope to keep it interactive and am happy to answer questions on anything to do with starting your own software business.</p> <p><b>About Our Speaker\u00a0</b></p> <p>Andy Brice is a UK-based software developer with nearly 30 years of professional software development experience.
