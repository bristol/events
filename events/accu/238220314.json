    "description": "<p>We are delighted to have Chris Simmons and Pedro\u00a0Ferreira with us, and they're going to do a dry run of their ACCU conference talk on Machine Learning in Python. \u00a0</p> <p>And thanks to our sponsors JetBrains, there'll be a chance to win a single user licence for one of their products. \u00a0</p> <p>After the talk, we will be heading off to the Brewdog for a beer, so please do come and join us.</p> <p>Synopsis:</p> <p>This presentation is a case study taken from the travel and holiday industry. Paxport/Multicom, based in UK and Sweden, have recently adopted a recommendation system for holiday accommodation bookings. Machine learning techniques such as Collaborative Filtering have been applied using Python (3.5.1), with Jupyter (4.0.6) as the main framework.\u00a0</p> <p>Data scale and sparsity present significant challenges in the case study, and so the effectiveness of various techniques are described as well as the performance of Python-based libraries such as Python Data Analysis Library (Pandas), and Scikit-learn (built on NumPy, SciPy and matplotlib).\u00a0</p> <p>We will look at how a problem mainly based in analysis and data modeling\u00a0can be alleviated\u00a0by the\u00a0notebook environment\u00a0provided by Jupyter is also provided.</p> <p>Bio -\u00a0After graduating in software engineering Pedro\u2019s interest in artificial intelligence led him to work in the video game industry for a year. That same interest has him now taking part of a Knowledge Transfer Partnership with Paxport(Multicom) and University of West of England working on a Machine Learning related problem.\u00a0</p> ",
