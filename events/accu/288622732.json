    "description": "<p>Hi everybody !</p> <p>Thank you to all those who attended the previous ACCU Bristol and Bath meetup. It was an excellent evening and thoroughly enjoyable - thanks.</p> <p>Now that everyone is back from holiday, I thought it was time for another meetup, so I am please to announce an evening of Lightning Talks to be held on the 27th of October 2022 at the Blu Wireless Office (details below).</p> <p>Lightning Talks are fun short presentations that range between 5 and 15 minutes. The talk can be based around anything that the presenter deems interesting for the audience. If you have an idea for a talk, then please email me a prospective title and a brief abstract.</p> <p>Please note that this event (as with its predecessor) will be held at the [Blu Wireless Bristol Office](<a href=\"https://www.bluwireless.com/contact-us/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.bluwireless.com/contact-us/</a>) and not at the Marriott (though the Blu Wireless Office is literally next to the hotel). The address is as follows:</p> <p>Blu Wireless<br/>4th Floor<br/>One Castlepark<br/>Tower Hill<br/>Bristol<br/>BS2 0JA</p> <p>The lightning talks will be followed by a trip to the Cornubia where the discussion will continue :-) !</p> <p>Thanks and hope to see you there !</p> <p>Jim</p> ",
