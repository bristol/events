The plan would be to turn up at 7pm for Burgers and food, then onwards to the Brewdog for further beers.</p> <p>We may need to book this, so I'd appreciate if you could let me know if you want to come along.</p> <p>*UPDATE*</p> <p>I've booked a table for 12 at Three Brothers for 6:30 under Williams, see you there</p> ",
