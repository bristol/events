Please find the abstract for the talk below. As usual, the talk will be hosted at the Blu Wireless offices (at One Castlepark, Tower Hill, BS2 0JA), with a trip to the Cornubia afterwards :-) !</p> <p>Also, I will be arranging a Summer Social in the interim - details of that to follow :-) !</p> <p>Looking forward to seeing you all and take care,</p> <p>Jim</p> <p>**The Windows File System**</p> <p>Programming for Windows can be challenging, especially in C++ where the wrappers and tools available in other programming environments are not so readily available.</p> <p>This talk focuses on the windows file system and makes an argument as to why we still need to use direct operating system calls rather than relying on the C++ standard library.</p> <p>The talk will include but is not limited to:</p> <p>\u2022 Long file paths<br/>\u2022 Character encoding (utf-8, wtf-8, utf-16, and wtf-16)<br/>\u2022 Securing sensitive data that may be spooled or hibernated to disk.<br/>\u2022 RAII style temporary files<br/>\u2022 The ubiquitous CreateFileW function<br/>\u2022 Checking if two file paths point to the same \u201cphysical\u201d location<br/>\u2022 File naming rules</p> <p>We focus on standard Win32 applications rather than the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) which was brought into being primarily for the now defunct \u201cWindows Mobile\u201d operating systems.</p> ",
