It is a programming paradigm that allows the programmer to describe a problem and the requirements on the solutions in an intuitive way, rather than describing the algorithm to find the solutions to the problem. ASP (Answer Set Programming) is a declarative programming paradigm with its roots in knowledge representation and reasoning, a subset of artificial intelligence. In this session we\u2019ll introduce you to the basic principles of this programming paradigm through guided exercises. You will get acquainted with concepts like negation as failure, closed world assumption and model generation.</p> <p>Join us for some hands-on fun! Learn how describing your problems is sometimes enough to get them solved.</p> <p><b>Practical notes:</b></p> <p>If you have a laptop, please bring it. We'll be programming in pairs, so if you don't have a laptop you can work with someone else.\u00a0We will be using the clingo program. You can install it on your own machine, or log in to our server with ssh. Installation on windows (easy) and mac (may be difficult): you can find the download link at\u00a0<a href=\"http://potassco.sourceforge.net/\"><a href=\"http://potassco.sourceforge.net/\" class=\"linkified\">http://potassco.sourceforge.net/</a></a> . Debian and Ubuntu: apt-get install clingo</p> <p><b>About our speakers:</b></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/6/8/4/600_268619012.jpeg\" /> <b>Marina de Vos</b> is a senior lecturer in the department of Computer Science at the University of Bath. Her main research area is themed \"Knowledge Representation and Reasoning\". In other words she tries to make programs reasoning \"intelligently\" about the information they have and make decisions on the basis of that reasoning process. Her main tool in this is a declarative programming paradigm called answer set programming.</p> <p><b>Willem van den Ende</b> works as an independent software developer, trainer and consultant.
