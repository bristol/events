    "description": "<p>I am deeply thrilled to close the year out with Bill Buchan who will be giving a talk on how to set up a Wireless ISP. What started as a conversation over a pint in the pub escalated in to a sizeable WISp in North Scotland.</p> <p>So please do join us for an evening that will be full of humour, and some amusing tales. And afterwards, join us at the pub, where the conversation will continue.</p> <p>Synopsis</p> <p>\u200b\u200bOn this talk, Bill Buchan will talk about the technology used and problems faced building a Wireless Internet Service Provider (WISP) - delivering cost effective rural internet. We shall walk through the nuts and bolts of the antenna, coverage, mapping, routing and traffic analysis.</p> <p>No C++ was harmed during this operation, but hopefully some Geolocation can get a good thrashing.</p> <p>Speaker Bio</p> <p>Bill is the owner, technology leader, main investor and jack-of-all-trades at <a href=\"https://www.Marykirk.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.Marykirk.com</a> and services 500+ rural customers over 300 very hilly square miles in rural Scotland. Bill has a long and somewhat exciting career in IT, working over most of Europe for such firms as IBM, Phillips, BAT, RBS, Chevron, and now BT. Oh, the irony.</p> ",
