    "description": "<p>I am extremely happy to announce that we've got the excellent James Pascoe speaking to us on the 19th, which promises to be a very exciting topic about Linux PCIe Network Drivers. \u00a0</p> <p>It promises to be an enjoyable evening.</p> <p>I'd like to thank our sponsors Jet Brains for giving us a 1 year licence to any of their products as a raffle prize, which we will be drawing.</p> <p>And post talk, we will decamp to the Brewdog for beers, or possibly another pub if the Brewdog is full, but we'll decide on the night.</p> <p><b>Talk Synopsis</b></p> <p>Writing a Linux network driver is the art of blending kernel abstractions with\u00a0hardware interactions - the intention being to achieve design goals that are\u00a0typically specified in terms of performance, robustness and security.\u00a0</p> <p>This talk\u00a0describes the development and internals of a complex PCIe network driver that\u00a0interfaces an[masked]ad multi-gigabit wireless network interface to the 4.8.8\u00a0Linux kernel.</p> <p>The talk introduces a number of PCIe concepts before\u00a0explaining the structure\u00a0of the code in detail. In particular, the presentation\u00a0will focus on the topics\u00a0of\u00a0initialisation, tear-down, the packet path (including IP\u00a0stack integration),\u00a0the use of threaded interrupt handlers (plus interrupt\u00a0mitigation with NAPI) and\u00a0user-space interactions through Netlink.</p> <p>This talk acts as both a primer for those who are interested in writing their\u00a0own network drivers and as an introduction to the existing code-bases in the Linux\u00a0kernel source tree.</p> <p><b>Speaker Bio</b></p> <p>James is interested in all things C, C++17 and Python.\u00a0James is currently a Senior\u00a0Software Engineer at Blu Wireless, where he\u00a0works on Linux device drivers,[masked]ad\u00a0MAC\u00a0firmware and developing Python tools for\u00a0processing large data-sets.\u00a0</p> <p>Prior to\u00a0joining Blu Wireless, James worked at Intel where he developed graphics infrastructure\u00a0for Android platforms. Before Intel, James was a Senior Microprocessor\u00a0Architect\u00a0at STMicroelectronics, where he was part of a team developing bespoke\u00a0(and later\u00a0ARM based) cores and CPU subsystems. James has also worked at U4EA\u00a0Technologies,\u00a0where he built novel QoS mechanisms for network routers. Before working in industry,\u00a0James\u00a0was a\u00a0post-doctoral Research Fellow in the Math and Computer\u00a0Science\u00a0department\u00a0at\u00a0Emory University, Atlanta, GA.\u00a0</p> <p>James holds a first\u00a0class degree and a PhD in Computer Science from The University\u00a0of Reading and an MBA (with distinction) from The University of Warwick.</p> ",
