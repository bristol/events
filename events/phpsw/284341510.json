    "description": "<p>PHP-SW return for another in real life event on Wednesday 9th March.</p> <p>We've got 3 talks to cover off where ever you are in your PHP journey.</p> <p>Things you should know about PHP (TBC)<br/>\\- Oliver Davis<br/>An introduction to PHP and the wider eco system.</p> <p>--<br/>AssertTrue(isDecoupled(\"MyTests\"))<br/>\\- Dave Liddament</p> <p>We all know why tests are great. But every once in a while we just wish they\u2019d never been written. One case when test regret occurs is when we want to alter our functionality slightly but in doing so half the test suite goes from green to red.<br/>This talk will investigate why this happens. In particular it looks at the coupling between tests and the code under test. We\u2019ll investigate ways we can reduce this coupling and make out test suites more resilient to change.</p> <p>--<br/>State of the recruitment market<br/>\\- Doug Gear<br/>Everyone is looking for developers. Doug will give an overview of the current market and useful tips for finding the right role.</p> <p>--<br/>Covid precautions: We're asking everyone to take a lateral flow test before attending the event, and only attend if negative. We also strongly encourage the use of masks.<br/>If you do have any queries about this, please contact us and we'll advise accordingly.</p> <p>--</p> <p>SR2 \u2013 Socially Responsible Recruitment (<a href=\"https://www.sr2rec.co.uk/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.sr2rec.co.uk/</a>) in Bristol are kindly helping us host this evening.
