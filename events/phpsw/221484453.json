PSR-7 relates HTTP Messages; HTTP request and response objects that describe the interaction between a client and server in any HTTP exchange. While this doesn\u2019t sound that interesting, PSR-7 threatens to open the door to truly interoperable libraries and frameworks, and heralds a new golden age for the next generation of PHP packages.</p> <p>Join us in this brief introduction to PSR-7 and the core concepts around phly/http, a concrete implementation of the standard.</p> <p>- <b>A Slim 3 primer</b><br/>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/php-sw/members/56661222\">Rob Allen</a>, Software Engineer, ZF contributor and author of <a href=\"http://www.manning.com/allen\">Zend Framework in Action</a></p> <p>Slim is a PHP micro framework that enables you to write powerful web applications and APIs. In this talk, I will give an overview of the upcoming third version of framework and show how you can easily write maintainable applications with it.</p> <p>--</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mixrad.io\">MixRadio</a> have kindly offered to host the evening at their office, and provide drinks and pizza.
