This months talks are...</p> <p>\\- Clean\\, Concise Collaborative Code<br/>Christopher Miller</p> <p>We look at why every time code is written we should ask ourselves 7 questions about our code that help us to put our thinking into the head of someone else reading our code in the future - or even ourselves! By asking these questions of ourselves, we can make sure we have Clean, Concise Collaborative Code - or code that someone else can work with.</p> <p>\\- And a talk from you?<br/>We've space for another full length talk or lightning talk.</p> <p>--</p> <p>SR2 \u2013 Socially Responsible Recruitment (<a href=\"https://www.sr2rec.co.uk/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.sr2rec.co.uk/</a>) in Bristol are kindly helping us host this evening.

It's a great chance to speak to people (we're a friendly bunch!) and do a bit of networking.
