An in person meetup?</p> <p>That's right, we're returning to in person meetups in November!</p> <p>We've got a talk about OpenAPI, plus space for a lightning talk if anyone wishes to volunteer. We're leaving plenty of time available for networking and speaking with others again though.</p> <p>--</p> <p>Please see the information further below for the covid measures we're putting in place.<br/>If you do have any queries about this, please contact us and we'll advise accordingly.</p> <p>At this stage we're unsure if we're going to offer pizza or not. When RSVPing, there is the option to answer a question on whether you would feel comfortable with shared pizzas - please let us know and we'll make a decision closer to the date.</p> <p>--</p> <p>SR2 \u2013 Socially Responsible Recruitment (<a href=\"https://www.sr2rec.co.uk/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.sr2rec.co.uk/</a>) in Bristol are kindly helping us host this evening. Thanks to them!</p> <p>This month's talks are:</p> <p>- Improve your API with OpenAPI<br/>(Rob Allen)</p> <p>OpenAPI is the standard way to describe your HTTP API, adopted by most modern APIs. With the spec at the centre of your workflow, you can improve the quality of your API and development practices, and make integrations painless. With standardisation comes tooling and in this session, I will show you to leverage this to your advantage. We'll cover what OpenAPI is, why it's interesting and then how to use it. We will also look at how the OpenAPI specification enables you to create documentation, use mock servers and improve the robustness of our API with validation. This session is ideal for anyone who wants to write an API specification once and use it everywhere.</p> <p>- If you're interested in giving a lightning talk, please let us know,</p> <p>After the talks we'll head somewhere for drinks.</p> <p>--<br/>Your first time coming to PHPSW? Welcome!</p> <p>Here's how the evening tends to run:<br/>* Feel free to turn up from 6:30pm.<br/>* We'll have a selection of soft drinks &amp; alcoholic drinks available from about 6:45pm, all free of charge thanks to our sponsors. It's a great chance to speak to people (we're a friendly bunch!) and do a bit of networking. Just speak to an organiser if you'd like an introduction to people, or just dive in and say \"hello!\".<br/>* At 7pm, we'll do a quick welcome talk and some community announcements<br/>* At ~7:10pm we'll have our first talk<br/>* After our first talk, there's a small break whilst we switch over speakers<br/>* At ~8:10pm We'll have a lightning talk<br/>* We finish at ~9pm. We always go for a drink somewhere afterwards to discuss the talks and anything else that takes your fancy.</p> <p>--<br/>As always, a big thanks to our meetup sponsors Ents24 (<a href=\"http://www.ents24.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.ents24.com/</a>), Brightpearl (<a href=\"http://www.brightpearl.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.brightpearl.com/</a>) &amp; OneSub (<a href=\"https://onesub.io/\" class=\"linkified\">https://onesub.io/</a>) without whom we wouldn't be able to put on our meetups.</p> ",
