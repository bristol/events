We'll be putting on a buffet and there will be a drink or two on us for you too.</p> <p>Rather than a full PHPub Quiz as we have done for the last couple of years, we're currently putting together a mix of smaller bits of entertainment for the evening (possibly including a small quiz...), but want to give plenty of time for chatting and socialising too.</p> <p>There will, of course, be plenty of prizes! What more could you ask for!</p> <p><b>Note:</b> Unfortunately we have had to hold this on the <b>second Tuesday </b>rather than the Wednesday. It wasn't a decision we took lightly, but gave us the best option for venues.</p> <p>--</p> <p>As always, a big thanks to our meetup sponsors\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.ents24.com/\">Ents24</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.brightpearl.com/\">Brightpearl</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.meanbee.com/\">Meanbee</a>\u00a0&amp; <a href=\"http://deepbluesky.com/\">Deep Blue Sky</a> without whom we wouldn't be able to put on events the likes of which we have this year.\u00a0</p> <p>--</p> <p><a href=\"https://phpsw.uk/events/227016878-phpub-quiz-2015\">View on the PHPSW website</a></p> ",
