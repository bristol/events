We're trying out a new venue this month - Desk Lodge.\u00a0</p> <p>- <b>Magento 2, The Transition into Modern PHP<br/></b><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/php-sw/members/24583172/\">Nathan McBride</a>, Certified Magento Developer at <a href=\"https://www.meanbee.com/\">Meanbee</a></p> <p>The talk will revolve around modern practises such as SOLID development, decoupling from frameworks so different corners of PHP communities can benefit each other, modular development and finally aspect orientated development.</p> <p>-\u00a0<b>Dive Into PHP 7</b><br/><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kasiazien\">Kat Zien</a>, Keyboard wizard, currently busy writing Go and PHP at <a href=\"https://www.brightpearl.com/\">Brightpearl</a></p> <p>We all eventually gave up discussing that famous article describing PHP's bad design, bought our t-shirts and got on with our lives. Some of us decided to give Ruby a go. Or Go. We all know PHP is far from perfect but it's still one of the most popular languages on the web (thanks Wordpress!) so... just get on with it. Right?</p> <p>Wrong!\u00a0</p> <p>There's a new kid in town. And it deserves your attention. Shame no more. Because PHP is not done yet!</p> <p>Over 10 years since its last major release, PHP 7 is now out and available. Heck, we're at 7.0.5 already! All this hard work, sweat, tears and swearing in the community brought us significant performance improvements, drastically reduced memory consumption, a brand spanking new Zend Engine and a host of new language features to make PHP shine again.</p> <p>Let's take a look at what's new. If you didn't get a chance to play around with PHP 7 yet I'll (hopefully) do the homework for you. If you're an expert already, looking forward to hearing what you think!</p> <p>--</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.desklodge.com/\">Desklodge</a>\u00a0is the new venue we're trying out. If you're looking for private offices, hot-desks or lounges to work in why not have a look round at the meetup.</p> <p>Afterwards we'll head to the pub, probably the\u00a0<a href=\"http://volunteertavern.co.uk/real-ales\">Volunteer Tavern</a>!</p> <p>--</p> <p><a href=\"http://phpsw.uk/events/230654971-upgrades\">View on the PHPSW website</a></p> ",
