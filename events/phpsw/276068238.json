(And tautologies are tautologies.) With more ease-of-use functionality than you can shake a stick at, PHP 8.0 promises to offer more power in less code than any PHP version to date.<br/>Covering the whole of PHP 8.0's improvements would take a whole book (and has), but we can cover the major features in an hour. Expect code that is easier to write, easier to read, and more flexible than ever before in the web\u2019s premiere server-side language.<br/>If after this talk you aren\u2019t itching to move your code to PHP 8.0, you\u2019re either asleep or not a PHP developer (so why are you here?)</p> <p>--</p> <p>Developer mindset - which comes first, the test or the code?<br/>Naomi Gotts (@naomigo)</p> <p>A brief investigation into and attempt to answer this age old question and how it is influenced (or not) by developer mindset.</p> <p>--</p> <p>Unfortunately we can't head anywhere afterwards for a drink, but we'll keep the chat going so that you can chat with each other.</p> <p>Once the talks are finished, we'll open up the meeting so that everyone who wants to can turn on their cameras and microphones to join in the conversation.</p> <p>You can also join us in Slack any time, just head to <a href=\"https://slack.phpsw.uk\" class=\"linkified\">https://slack.phpsw.uk</a></p> <p>--<br/>Your first time coming to PHPSW? Welcome!</p> <p>It's going to be a bit different this month as we're all online, but we expect the night to roughly run as:</p> <p>* From about 6:45 you should be able to join the event.<br/>* At 7pm, we'll do a quick welcome talk and some community announcements<br/>* At ~7:10pm we'll have the talks<br/>* We finish talks at ~8:30pm, but will keep the event going till 9pm (or beyond) so you can join in the conversation</p> <p>--<br/>How is this online thing going to work?</p> <p>We've decided to use Zoom to host the event.</p> <p>You'll find the link for the webinar under the location section of this event. You'll be able to access the event from the start time and it will prompt you to install a client if you wish/need to. There is also a web client available.<br/>On joining you will be asked for an email address. We're not messaging attendees etc. so this can be a non-real address.</p> <p>Note: We will be restricting video and screen sharing to hosts and speakers only until after the talks.</p> <p>Please be aware that our code of conduct (<a href=\"https://phpsw.uk/code-of-conduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://phpsw.uk/code-of-conduct</a>) still applies.</p> <p>--<br/>As always, a big thanks to our meetup sponsors Ents24 (<a href=\"http://www.ents24.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.ents24.com/</a>), Brightpearl (<a href=\"http://www.brightpearl.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.brightpearl.com/</a>) &amp; OneSub (<a href=\"https://onesub.io/\" class=\"linkified\">https://onesub.io/</a>) without whom we wouldn't be able to put on our meetups.</p> ",
