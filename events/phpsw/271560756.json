Code coverage is not necessarily a good indicator to answer this question. What other options do we have? Do we need tests to test the quality of our tests? In some way, yes we do. In this session, I will introduce you to the concept of mutation-based testing and how this technique can be used to improve the quality of your test suite.</p> <p>- Websockets in practice<br/>Mike Smith (@M1ke)</p> <p>Using websockets and event-driven PHP libraries we can create real time applications that benefit our users. In this live coding session Mike will introduce websockets, how you can write event-driven code using ReactPHP and demonstrate some front end code to hook up to it. Take this as the building block of real time applications for your business or project.</p> <p>--</p> <p>Unfortunately we can't head anywhere afterwards for a drink, but we'll keep the chat going so that you can chat with each other.</p> <p>This month, we're going to look at opening up the zoom conversation after the talks for anyone to be able to chat etc.</p> <p>You can also join us in Slack any time, just head to <a href=\"https://slack.phpsw.uk\" class=\"linkified\">https://slack.phpsw.uk</a><br/>--<br/>Your first time coming to PHPSW? Welcome!</p> <p>It's going to be a bit different this month as we're all online, but we expect the night to roughly run as:</p> <p>* From about 6:45 you should be able to join the event.<br/>* At 7pm, we'll do a quick welcome talk and some community announcements<br/>* At ~7:10pm we'll have our first talk<br/>* After our first talk, there's a small break whilst we switch over speakers<br/>* At ~8:10pm We have our second talk<br/>* We finish at ~9pm, but will keep chat going for up to a couple of hours or until</p> <p>--<br/>How is this online thing going to work?</p> <p>We've decided to use Zoom to host the event.</p> <p>You'll find the link for the webinar under the location section of this event from a couple of days before. You'll be able to access the event from the start time and it will prompt you to install a client if you wish/need to. There is also a web client available.<br/>On joining you will be asked for an email address. We're not messaging attendees etc. so this can be a non-real address.</p> <p>Note: We will be restricting video and screen sharing to hosts and speakers only until after the talks.</p> <p>Please be aware that our code of conduct (<a href=\"https://phpsw.uk/code-of-conduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://phpsw.uk/code-of-conduct</a>) still applies.</p> <p>--<br/>As always, a big thanks to our meetup sponsors Ents24 (<a href=\"http://www.ents24.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.ents24.com/</a>), Brightpearl (<a href=\"http://www.brightpearl.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.brightpearl.com/</a>), BookingLive (<a href=\"https://www.bookinglive.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.bookinglive.com/</a>) &amp; OneSub (<a href=\"https://onesub.io/\" class=\"linkified\">https://onesub.io/</a>) without whom we wouldn't be able to put on our meetups.</p> ",
