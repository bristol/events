    "description": "<p>For April's meetup we have the amazing Rob Allen teaching us how to automate everything with Github actions:</p> <p>**Automate all the things with CI/CD in Github Actions**<br/>Rob Allen</p> <p>*We have many tools to help us build an application consistently with high quality from code formatting, through static analysis and testing. We can run them locally, but that's too easy to forget, so they really come into their own when we run them automatically within GitHub, and that's what we'll cover in this talk. I'll show you how to set up workflows in GitHub actions to check for all the common and not-so-common items that will make it easier to accept changes into the project and then follow on from there to show how we can also create releases and deploy automatically too. By the end of this session you'll be able to create your own workflows that will automate the your tooling.*</p> <p>\\-\\-\\-\\-<br/>SR2 \u2013 Socially Responsible Recruitment (<a href=\"https://www.sr2rec.co.uk/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.sr2rec.co.uk/</a>) are kindly helping us host this evening.
