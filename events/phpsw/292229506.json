If you're keen to do one then drop us a line).</p> <p>\\-\\-\\-<br/>**Minimum Viable\u00a0PHPipeline**</p> <p>The honeymoon period is over, and your company or customer is demanding stability in your PHP applications.</p> <p>I'm going to talk about some essential strategies to set up Continuous Integration and Delivery pipelines to help maintain, and - over time - improve the quality of the software your team delivers.</p> <p>You'll learn about some of the tools necessary to set these pipelines up, basic design of CI pipelines, and some key strategies for automating deployments. I'll show you how having a solid CI/CD pipeline means that you can still deliver software fast, but with confidence that your deliverables are steadily getting better.</p> <p>\\-\\-\\-</p> <p>SR2 \u2013 Socially Responsible Recruitment (<a href=\"https://www.sr2rec.co.uk/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.sr2rec.co.uk/</a>) are kindly helping us host this evening.
