In the day to day life of a developer, becoming comfortable with them opens up many more use cases.</p> <p>As one of the tortured souls that actually enjoys writing - and reading - regexes, Jordi will share his passion so that you too can see there is no reason to worry.</p> <p>- <b>Generated Power: PHP 5.5 Generators</b><br/>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mark_baker\">Mark Baker</a>, Coordinator and Lead Developer of <a href=\"https://github.com/PHPOffice\">the PHPOffice library suite</a></p> <p>One of the new features that was introduced in PHP 5.5: Generators provide an iterable alternative to arrays, or to classes that implement the Iterator interface. At the simplest level, they don't add anything new to PHP that you couldn't already do before, simply returning values or key/value pairs to a loop; though they do give you options to perform certain iterative functions without the memory overheads of an array, or without the complexities of lots of boilerplate code that an Iterator class requires.</p> <p>But look more closely at Generators, and they can be used for much more complex purposes: from simulating arrays with duplicate keys, or keys that aren't simple integer or string values, to accepting new data each iteration rather than simply returning it, so that you can actually modify their behaviour dynamically, or build Cooperative subroutines, even to simulate parallel processing.</p> <p>Generators add real power to PHP.</p> <p>--</p> <p><a href=\"http://tech.just-eat.com\">JUST EAT</a> have kindly offered to host the evening at their fantastic new office, as well as provide drinks and pizza.
