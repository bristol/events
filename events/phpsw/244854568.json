We'll be providing a couple of drinks for everyone and a small buffet.</p> <p>As well as plenty of time for chatting and socialising, we'll be organising a few activities (possibly including the return of JeoPHPardy) and giving away plenty of prizes too.</p> <p>--</p> <p>As always, a big thanks to our meetup sponsors\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.ents24.com/\">Ents24</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.brightpearl.com/\">Brightpearl</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.meanbee.com/\">Meanbee</a>, <a href=\"http://deepbluesky.com/\">Deep Blue Sky</a>\u00a0&amp; <a href=\"https://equiniticybersecurity.com/careers/\">Equiniti</a> without whom we wouldn't be able to put on events the likes of which we have this year.\u00a0</p> <p>We'd also like to thank\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/phptraininguk\">@phptraininguk</a> who are kindly buying the first round of drinks, and <a href=\"https://laracon.net/\">Laracon Online</a> for providing us with two tickets to include as raffle prizes.</p> <p>\ud83c\udf84 \ud83c\udf89 \ud83c\udf7b\u00a0</p> ",
