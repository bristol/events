It swept the Ops world by storm in 2014, became mainstream in 2015, and now it\u2019s set to dominate the developer world, in 2016. Docker is a tool that allows you to package your application up into a single-runnable distributable binary - akin to the phar, but in Hulk mode. Docker allows you, a developer, to specify the exact environment your application needs to run, across development; test; staging; and production. In this talk I will cover the creation of this utopian distributable and show you how to can compose your entire production infrastructure locally with only a small YAML file and without installing a single thing. Lets say hello, to Docker.</p> <p>- <b>The realpath to a happy Opcache</b><br/>\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/php-sw/members/39370012\">Tom Adam</a>, \u00a0Developer at <a href=\"http://www.instantiate.co.uk/\">Instantiate</a></p> <p>A look at Opcache and the realpath cache, the issues they cause during deployment and suggested solutions.</p> <p>--</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.brightpearl.com/\">Brightpearl</a>\u00a0have kindly offered to host the evening at their office, and as always we'll sort out some ales, lagers, soft drinks and snacks.
