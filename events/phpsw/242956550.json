    "description": "<p>In September it's a PHP-NW preview show. We've got 2 devops related talks, and they are both conference talks.</p> <p>Thanks to BaseKit for kindly hosting us this month.</p> <p>Our talks this month:</p> <p><b>-\u00a0Meet Terraform</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/php-sw/members/201903363/\">&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/mheap\"&gt;Michael Heap</a>, developer advocate at <a href=\"https://www.nexmo.com/\">Nexmo</a>\u00a0and author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1484216601\">Ansible: Beginner to pro</a><a href=\"http://www.rocketmakers.com/\">&lt;/a&gt;</p> <p>We have a ton of options for provisioning machines once we have an SSH connection\u00a0available, but how do we get those machines in the first place?\u00a0</p> <p>Meet Terraform from Hashicorp, your infrastructure automation engine. Providing a\u00a0declarative interface for your infrastructure, you can define what you need and let\u00a0Terraform take care of the rest.\u00a0</p> <p>In this talk, we'll take a look at what Terraform can do for you, walking through your\u00a0first Terraform configuration all the way to writing your own modules to encapsulate\u00a0your infrastructure across multiple deployments.</p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>-\u00a0Deploying PHP Applications with Fabric<br/></b>&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/MPOram\"&gt;</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/opdavies\">Oliver Davies</a>, Senior Developer at <a href=\"https://microserve.io/\">Microserve</a>.<a href=\"https://maydenacademy.co.uk/\">&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.instantiate.co.uk/\"&gt;</a></p> <p>You\u2019ve built your application, and now you just need to deploy it. There are various ways that this could be done \u2013 from (S)FTP, to SCP and rsync, to running commands like \u201cgit pull\u201d and \u201ccomposer install\u201d directly on the server (not recommended).</p> <p>My favourite deployment tool of late is\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.fabfile.org/\">Fabric</a>\u00a0\u2013 a Python based command line tool for running commands locally as well as on remote servers. It\u2019s language and framework agnostic, and unopinionated so you define the steps and workflow that you need \u2013 from a basic few-step deployment to a full Capistrano style zero-downtime deployment.</p> <p>This talk will cover some introduction to Fabric and how to write your own fabfiles, and then look at some examples of different use case deployments for your PHP project.</p> <p>--\u00a0</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.basekit.com/\">BaseKit</a> have kindly offered to host the evening at their office, and as always we'll sort out some ales, lagers, soft drinks and snacks. Don't forget to check them out - and if you're looking, they are hiring.</p> <p>As always, a big thanks to our meetup sponsors <a href=\"http://www.ents24.com/\">Ents24</a>, <a href=\"http://www.brightpearl.com/\">Brightpearl</a>, <a href=\"https://www.meanbee.com/\">Meanbee</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://deepbluesky.com/\">Deep Blue Sky</a> without whom we wouldn't be able to put on our meetups.\u00a0</p> <p>Afterwards we'll head to the pub, probably the\u00a0<a href=\"http://volunteertavern.co.uk/real-ales\">Volunteer Tavern</a>!</p> <p>--</p> <p>View on the PHPSW website</p> ",
