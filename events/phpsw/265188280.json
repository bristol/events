    "description": "<p>In October join us at DeskLodge for talks about Refactoring large PHP applications and useful things to know as a developer.</p> <p>This month's talks are:</p> <p>- Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Playing \"Developer\"<br/>Gary Hockin</p> <p>I'm a gamer, and some of my favourite articles to read about computer games are those click-bait posts that read \"Ten Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Playing Pac-Man!\".<br/>When you're playing computer games, it's easy to miss things that are obvious to others, and these posts can help you to understand a simple game mechanic that you'd otherwise have not used. It got me thinking about the things in my own career that I found out about too late, or didn't fully understand until much later than I needed it.<br/>We'll cover both the technical and the conversational, so join me, as I introduce you to Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Playing \"Developer\".</p> <p>- Refactoring Huge Legacy PHP Applications - From 100 hours to minutes<br/>Tomas Votruba</p> <p>Before the composer, we downloaded packages manually, one by one. Now you run \"composer update symfony/symfony 4.2\" and you can jump from 3.0 to 4.2 in seconds.</p> <p>But how do you fix BC breaks in your code? Manually, one change after another, file by file? That's a daunting and stereotype work.</p> <p>In PHP there is AST (abstract syntax tree) tools, that can automate this upgrade. Write the rule once, apply it in 1000 classes in seconds.</p> <p>I'll show you how working with legacy code can be fun again.</p> <p>Afterwards we'll head to the pub, probably the Volunteer Tavern (<a href=\"http://volunteertavern.co.uk/real-ales\" class=\"linkified\">http://volunteertavern.co.uk/real-ales</a>)!</p> <p>--<br/>Your first time coming to PHPSW? Welcome!</p> <p>Here's how the evening tends to run:<br/>* Feel free to turn up from 6:30pm.<br/>* We'll have pizza and a selection of soft drinks &amp; alcoholic drinks available from about 6:45pm, all free of charge thanks to our sponsors. It's a great chance to speak to people (we're a friendly bunch!) and do a bit of networking. Just speak to an organiser if you'd like an introduction to people, or just dive in and say \"hello!\".<br/>* At 7pm, we'll do a quick welcome talk and some community announcements<br/>* At ~7:10pm we'll have our first talk<br/>* After our first talk, there's a small break whilst we switch over speakers<br/>* At ~8:10pm We have our second talk<br/>* We finish at ~9pm. We always go for a drink somewhere afterwards to discuss the talks and anything else that takes your fancy.</p> <p>--<br/>As always, a big thanks to our regular meetup sponsors Ents24 (<a href=\"http://www.ents24.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.ents24.com/</a>), Brightpearl (<a href=\"http://www.brightpearl.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.brightpearl.com/</a>), Space 48 (<a href=\"https://www.space48.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.space48.com/</a>) &amp; OneSub (<a href=\"https://onesub.io/\" class=\"linkified\">https://onesub.io/</a>) without whom we wouldn't be able to put on our meetups.</p> ",
