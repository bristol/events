Why are they beneficial though, what pitfalls are there and how could the process be improved? Lee talks about some of his experiences and what he'd like to improve this year.</p> <p><b>-\u00a0Go Faster with Ansible<br/></b><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/php-sw/members/13372662/\">Richard Donkin</a></p> <p>Deploy PHP apps faster in 2017. This talk focuses on how PHP developers can use simple Ansible scripts to rapidly configure new dev and production servers from scratch, and deploy their apps.\u00a0 No more \"snowflake servers\"!</p> <p><b>-\u00a0An introduction to the Symfony Console Component<br/></b><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/php-sw/members/154425842/\">Mike Lovely</a>, developer at <a href=\"https://simpleweb.co.uk/\">SimpleWeb</a></p> <p>Automate a task by creating a simple command for it.
