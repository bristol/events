This talk will explain where PhpSpec enters the equation, discuss how it does and doesn't differ to PhpUnit and demonstrate its power to force you to think about the architecture of your code.</p> <p>- Unconventional PHP<br/>Liam Hammett</p> <p>You might think you know PHP, but if you dig below the surface you might find it can do more than you knew. Beyond the documented features, there lies a world of tricks, hacks and other techniques that can allow PHP to go a step further.</p> <p>In this talk we'll look outside the box at some things PHP provides like references, autoloading and magic methods and explore how using them in an unconventional way can benefit our own code.</p> <p>--</p> <p>Unfortunately we can't head anywhere afterwards for a drink, but we'll keep the chat going so that you can chat with each other.</p> <p>Once the talks are finished, we'll open up the meeting so that everyone who wants to can turn on their cameras and microphones to join in the conversation.</p> <p>You can also join us in Slack any time, just head to <a href=\"https://slack.phpsw.uk\" class=\"linkified\">https://slack.phpsw.uk</a></p> <p>--<br/>Your first time coming to PHPSW? Welcome!</p> <p>It's going to be a bit different this month as we're all online, but we expect the night to roughly run as:</p> <p>* From about 6:45 you should be able to join the event.<br/>* At 7pm, we'll do a quick welcome talk and some community announcements<br/>* At ~7:10pm we'll have our first talk<br/>* After our first talk, there's a small break whilst we switch over speakers<br/>* At ~8:10pm We have our second talk<br/>* We finish talks at ~9pm, but will keep the event going till 10pm so you can join in the conversation</p> <p>--<br/>How is this online thing going to work?</p> <p>We've decided to use Zoom to host the event.</p> <p>You'll find the link for the webinar under the location section of this event from a couple of days before. You'll be able to access the event from the start time and it will prompt you to install a client if you wish/need to. There is also a web client available.<br/>On joining you will be asked for an email address. We're not messaging attendees etc. so this can be a non-real address.</p> <p>Note: We will be restricting video and screen sharing to hosts and speakers only until after the talks.</p> <p>Please be aware that our code of conduct (<a href=\"https://phpsw.uk/code-of-conduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://phpsw.uk/code-of-conduct</a>) still applies.</p> <p>--<br/>As always, a big thanks to our meetup sponsors Ents24 (<a href=\"http://www.ents24.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.ents24.com/</a>), Brightpearl (<a href=\"http://www.brightpearl.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.brightpearl.com/</a>), BookingLive (<a href=\"https://www.bookinglive.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.bookinglive.com/</a>) &amp; OneSub (<a href=\"https://onesub.io/\" class=\"linkified\">https://onesub.io/</a>) without whom we wouldn't be able to put on our meetups.</p> ",
