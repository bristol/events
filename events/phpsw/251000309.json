Thanks to them!</p> <p>This month's talks are:</p> <p>- Time Zones and Calendars are a PITA<br/>Derick Rethans, Senior Engineer at MongoDB 7 Author of Xdebug (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/derickr\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/derickr</a>)</p> <p>Time Zones and Calendars are a PITA. Although they govern how we live and when we do what, handling them programmatically is not an easy feat.</p> <p>In this presentation we will look at how to deal with time zones, and two calendars: natural year, and ISO8601. We will see how it is hard to make assumptions on how they work, and explain how they came into existence. We\u2019ll focus mostly on how to handle them from within PHP, as well as how we (should) store them in databases. We\u2019ll also have a quick look at date manipulation when querying data.</p> <p>- Build your own Neural Network, with PHP!<br/>V\u00edtor Brand\u00e3o, FOSS Enthusiast &amp; Director at Noiselabs Consulting (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/noiselabs\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/noiselabs</a>)</p> <p>Curious about all the hype around Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence? Heard of \"Neural Networks\" and \"Deep Learning\" but confused about what it really means?</p> <p>In this talk you'll see what Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) look like and how they can \"learn\". And along the way you'll discover how you can build your own ANN, with PHP of course!</p> <p>--<br/>SR2 \u2013 Socially Responsible Recruitment in Bristol have kindly offered to cover hosting costs for the evening, which is helping us have a larger venue! You may have noticed Nathaniel floating around at previous events - Nathaniel helps PHP Developers find jobs that fit their aspirations - whether you are a seasoned developer looking to take the next step in your career, or a junior about to embark on a career in development, with partnerships with some of Bristol\u2019s most impressive companies Nathaniel will be able to help you. Grab a coffee or beer with him!</p> <p>You can find out more about SR2 at <a href=\"https://www.sr2rec.co.uk/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.sr2rec.co.uk/</a></p> <p>--</p> <p>As always, a big thanks to our meetup sponsors Ents24 (<a href=\"http://www.ents24.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.ents24.com/</a>), Brightpearl (<a href=\"http://www.brightpearl.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.brightpearl.com/</a>), Space 48 (<a href=\"https://www.space48.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.space48.com/</a>) &amp; Deep Blue Sky (<a href=\"http://deepbluesky.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://deepbluesky.com/</a>) without whom we wouldn't be able to put on our meetups.</p> <p>Afterwards we'll head to the pub, probably the Volunteer Tavern (<a href=\"http://volunteertavern.co.uk/real-ales\" class=\"linkified\">http://volunteertavern.co.uk/real-ales</a>)!</p> ",
