    "description": "<p>In March join us at Runway East for 2 great talks. We start off by taking a look at how Mayden scaled their development team and then we take a look at Lumen.</p> <p>SR2 \u2013 Socially Responsible Recruitment (<a href=\"https://www.sr2rec.co.uk/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.sr2rec.co.uk/</a>) in Bristol are kindly helping us host this evening, allowing us to have a larger space so more people can attend. Thanks to them!</p> <p>This month's talks are:</p> <p>- Scaling The Development Team at Mayden<br/>Dave Bould &amp; Louis Rickman, Mayden</p> <p>Louis and Dave have a combined 17 years experience working for Mayden.</p> <p>This is a story about how Mayden went from a team of 5 to 20 developers growing rapidly in a short amount of time, the problems that came with quick growth and how we transformed our team from a daily firefight to development team of the year!</p> <p>- Lighting up relationships in Lumen<br/>Liam Maddison</p> <p>This is a story of when I was a young developer trying to learn the backend, I did not know where to turn and with all the information on the internet It was extremely overwhelming. The talk will cover important groundings I learnt through using frameworks (eg Lumen), such as database schemas, migrations and relationships.</p> <p>After the talks we will stay for drinks. Yes the venue, Runway East, has it's own bar!</p> <p>--<br/>Your first time coming to PHPSW? Welcome!</p> <p>Here's how the evening tends to run:<br/>* Feel free to turn up from 6:30pm.<br/>* We'll have pizza and a selection of soft drinks &amp; alcoholic drinks available from about 6:45pm, all free of charge thanks to our sponsors. It's a great chance to speak to people (we're a friendly bunch!) and do a bit of networking. Just speak to an organiser if you'd like an introduction to people, or just dive in and say \"hello!\".<br/>* At 7pm, we'll do a quick welcome talk and some community announcements<br/>* At ~7:10pm we'll have our first talk<br/>* After our first talk, there's a small break whilst we switch over speakers<br/>* At ~8:10pm We have our second talk<br/>* We finish at ~9pm. We always go for a drink somewhere afterwards to discuss the talks and anything else that takes your fancy. This month we'll be stopping at the venue as they have their own bar.</p> <p>--<br/>As always, a big thanks to our meetup sponsors Ents24 (<a href=\"http://www.ents24.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.ents24.com/</a>), Brightpearl (<a href=\"http://www.brightpearl.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.brightpearl.com/</a>), Space 48 (<a href=\"https://www.space48.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.space48.com/</a>) &amp; Deep Blue Sky (<a href=\"http://deepbluesky.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://deepbluesky.com/</a>) without whom we wouldn't be able to put on our meetups.</p> ",
