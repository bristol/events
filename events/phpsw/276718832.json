    "description": "<p>We turn (virtually) this month to learn all about building APIs in Laravel.</p> <p>We're going to be using Zoom for the event - the link will be added a couple of days beforehand.</p> <p>So grab your own pizza and a drink and join us for an evening of informative talks.</p> <p>A big thanks to our sponsors SR2 (<a href=\"https://www.sr2rec.co.uk/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.sr2rec.co.uk/</a>), Ents24 (<a href=\"http://www.ents24.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.ents24.com/</a>), Brightpearl (<a href=\"http://www.brightpearl.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.brightpearl.com/</a>), BookingLive (<a href=\"https://www.bookinglive.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.bookinglive.com/</a>) &amp; OneSub (<a href=\"https://onesub.io/\" class=\"linkified\">https://onesub.io/</a>) who are supporting us and are helping make the virtual event happen.</p> <p>Our talks are:</p> <p>- Building APIs in Laravel; a simple approach to scale<br/>Steve McDougall (@JustSteveKing)</p> <p>Building APIs can be easy right, we design the data model, slap some routes in and controllers to wrap our ORM access.</p> <p>But is this efficient, and does it scale? What happens when our application grows to a point where we have 100s of Models and more scopes than your average game of Call of Duty? How can we structure and approach our APIs in Laravel, so that scale from a code perspective isn't an issue?</p> <p>In this talk I will take you through how I approach this problem, and have been approaching this problem for the last few years.</p> <p>--</p> <p>You? There is still space for another talk.</p> <p>--</p> <p>Unfortunately we can't head anywhere afterwards for a drink, but we'll keep the chat going so that you can chat with each other.</p> <p>Once the talks are finished, we'll open up the meeting so that everyone who wants to can turn on their cameras and microphones to join in the conversation.</p> <p>You can also join us in Slack any time, just head to <a href=\"https://slack.phpsw.uk\" class=\"linkified\">https://slack.phpsw.uk</a></p> <p>--<br/>Your first time coming to PHPSW? Welcome!</p> <p>It's going to be a bit different this month as we're all online, but we expect the night to roughly run as:</p> <p>* From about 6:45 you should be able to join the event.<br/>* At 7pm, we'll do a quick welcome talk and some community announcements<br/>* At ~7:10pm we'll have the talks<br/>* We finish talks at ~8:30pm, but will keep the event going till 9pm (or beyond) so you can join in the conversation</p> <p>--<br/>How is this online thing going to work?</p> <p>We've decided to use Zoom to host the event.</p> <p>You'll find the link for the webinar under the location section of this event. You'll be able to access the event from the start time and it will prompt you to install a client if you wish/need to. There is also a web client available.<br/>On joining you will be asked for an email address. We're not messaging attendees etc. so this can be a non-real address.</p> <p>Note: We will be restricting video and screen sharing to hosts and speakers only until after the talks.</p> <p>Please be aware that our code of conduct (<a href=\"https://phpsw.uk/code-of-conduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://phpsw.uk/code-of-conduct</a>) still applies.</p> <p>--<br/>As always, a big thanks to our meetup sponsors Ents24 (<a href=\"http://www.ents24.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.ents24.com/</a>), Brightpearl (<a href=\"http://www.brightpearl.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.brightpearl.com/</a>) &amp; OneSub (<a href=\"https://onesub.io/\" class=\"linkified\">https://onesub.io/</a>) without whom we wouldn't be able to put on our meetups.</p> ",
