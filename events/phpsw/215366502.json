Some features aren\u2019t going to make the cut, but the boss really wants to make sure these critical bugs are fixed. You can\u2019t wait for the release cycle to be over so you can relax.</p> <p>But what if I told you it didn\u2019t have to be that way? What if I could show you how to create a world where there is no release cycle? A world where weekend deployments are a rarity, not the norm?! In this talk we will cover the steps we took to achieve the coding utopia of releasing a feature as soon as it\u2019s ready - many times per day. You\u2019ll find out that by implementing a continuous deployment flow, you can empower your developers to take ownership and become more productive.</p> <p>-\u00a0<b>Security in the face of adversity</b>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lowlysysadm1n\">Dave Tibbs</a>, Systems Administrator\u00a0at\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.brightpearl.com\">Brightpearl</a>\u00a0US, briefly in the UK!</p> <p>--</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.brightpearl.com\">Brightpearl</a>\u00a0have kindly offered to host the evening, providing food, beers and their office as the venue.
