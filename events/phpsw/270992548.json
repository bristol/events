And if the internet was a country it would be the sixth biggest polluter in the world. Shocking isn\u2019t?</p> <p>Tech provides wonderful opportunities to find ways to reduce our carbon emissions, but in itself has a significant environmental cost, which most of us aren\u2019t conscious of.</p> <p>In this talk we\u2019ll discuss why &amp; how tech and building websites has an environmental impact. We\u2019ll look at tools and techniques you can use to lessen your impact, whether you are responsible as a developer, designer or content creator. And of course, not only do these tools and techniques help your green credentials, they nearly always result in better performance and better user experiences too.</p> <p>- Get, Set ... STOP!<br/>Zvonimir Spajic (@konrad_126)</p> <p>Wikipedia defines Cargo cult programming as \"Ritual inclusion of code or program structures that serve no real purpose.\"</p> <p>One behaviour, deeply embedded into the hearts and minds of many software developers is the creation of getters and setter on entities. It' so widespread that IDEs have tools to do it automatically.</p> <p>Why do we do it? Does it serve some purpose or is it just a cargo cult programming ritual?</p> <p>--</p> <p>Unfortunately we can't head anywhere afterwards for a drink, but we'll keep the chat going so that you can chat with each other.</p> <p>This month, we're going to look at opening up the zoom conversation after the talks for anyone to be able to chat etc.</p> <p>You can also join us in Slack any time, just head to <a href=\"https://slack.phpsw.uk\" class=\"linkified\">https://slack.phpsw.uk</a><br/>--<br/>Your first time coming to PHPSW?
