Welcome to Phanstatic, a small side project of Tamas Erdelyi and yet another static site generator written in pure PHP.</p> <p>In his talk, Tamas will remind us why the size of websites still matters in 2024. He will also demonstrate how to build and deploy blogs and microsites using this command-line PHP package by creating just a few files and folders. No need to step out of your PHP comfort zone or worry about a new template engine syntax!</p> <p>\\-\\-\\-\\-<br/>SR2 \u2013 Socially Responsible Recruitment (<a href=\"https://www.sr2rec.co.uk/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.sr2rec.co.uk/</a>) are kindly helping us host this evening. Thanks to them!</p> <p>Your first time coming to PHPSW? Welcome!<br/>Here's how the evening tends to run:</p> <p>* Feel free to turn up from 6:30pm.<br/>* We'll have a selection of soft drinks &amp; alcoholic drinks available from about 6:45pm, all free of charge thanks to our sponsors. It's a great chance to speak to people (we're a friendly bunch!) and do a bit of networking. Just speak to an organiser if you'd like an introduction to people, or just dive in and say \"hello!\".<br/>* At 7pm, we'll do a quick welcome talk and some community announcements<br/>* At \\~7:10pm we'll start our talks<br/>* We finish at \\~9pm. We always go for a drink somewhere afterwards to discuss the talks and anything else that takes your fancy. \ud83d\udc18</p> ",
