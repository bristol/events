Welcome to Phanstatic, a small side project of Tamas Erdelyi and yet another static site generator written in pure PHP.</p> <p>In his talk, Tamas will remind us why the size of websites still matters in 2024. He will also demonstrate how to build and deploy blogs and microsites using this command-line PHP package by creating just a few files and folders. No need to step out of your PHP comfort zone or worry about a new template engine syntax!</p> <p>\\-\\-\\-\\-<br/>SR2 \u2013 Socially Responsible Recruitment (<a href=\"https://www.sr2rec.co.uk/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.sr2rec.co.uk/</a>) are kindly helping us host this evening.
