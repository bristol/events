In this talk, I\u2019m not going to give any code examples - there are thousands of talks that do that. Instead, I will illustrate the concept of git rebase using the world of comic book continuity.</p> <p>- <b>Open Source Communities as Fandoms</b><br/>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jesslynnrose\">Jessica Rose</a>, Technologist and enthusiasm enthusiast</p> <p>How is Docker like Doctor Who? They\u2019re both projects supported by an incredibly motivated community. This talk will look at the ways in which open source communities parallel fandoms as they form, grow, break off into factions and interact with their fans and critics. As we learn more about our own communities by looking at our equally-obsessed geeky peers we\u2019ll hopefully discover ways that we can help make our open source communities more equitable, accessible and\u2026well\u2026open!</p> <p>--</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mixrad.io/\">MixRadio</a>\u00a0have kindly offered to host the evening at their office, and provide drinks and pizza.
