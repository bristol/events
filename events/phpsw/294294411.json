If you have a PHP problem that you're stuck on then let us know, and hopefully someone in the meetup will be able to help.</p> <p>\\-\\-\\-<br/>**What is TDD and why should I care?**<br/>(How to explain TDD to a non-technical audience)<br/>*[Naomi Gotts](<a href=\"https://twitter.com/naomigo\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/naomigo</a>)*</p> <p>To the non-technical world, TDD is just another acronym that developers drop into conversations every now and then. For those of us on the technical side of the fence, we know that being able to work test-first is a skill. A skill that takes practice and perseverance to hone and reap the benefits from. But why should our business stakeholders care about helping and supporting us on our TDD journeys?</p> <p>As developers we are often faced with the challenge of having to explain technical subjects to non-technical colleagues. This talk will delve into the business case for TDD, explaining why it is important and using an interactive example to demonstrate how it helps improve development flow. It will leave attendees with a specific example and a more generic overall approach to presenting technical topics to non-technical audiences.</p> <p>**Lightning talk**</p> <p>If you'd like to give a lighting talk (5-10mins), then let us know and we'll book you in.<br/>\\-\\-\\-</p> <p>SR2 \u2013 [Socially Responsible Recruitment](<a href=\"https://www.sr2rec.co.uk/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.sr2rec.co.uk/</a>) are kindly helping us host this evening.
