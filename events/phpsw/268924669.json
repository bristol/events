Thanks to them!</p> <p>This month's talks are:</p> <p>- The La(te)st PHP 7 \u2014 What's new in PHP 7.4<br/>Derick Rethans (Release manager for PHP 7.4 and author of Xdebug)</p> <p>We are going to look at the new features in PHP 7.4. Join me to have a look at how the type system is strengthened with typed properties and co- and contra-variance of methods, what changes to operator precedence are, and which new features, such as pre-loading classes, have been added.</p> <p>- The Making of a Great API<br/>Rob Allen</p> <p>Everyone is writing APIs but what makes a great one? I will take you on a tour of the most important features that you should think about when creating an API. These ensure that your API plays well with HTTP and make your API a delight to maintain and work with. Give your API a competitive edge by making it great and developers will want to work with it.</p> <p>What you'll learn from this talk:</p> <p>We will cover the most important things that make up a great API. You will learn:</p> <p>The importance of following the HTTP spec in terms of key parts of RFC7321 along with the how and why of API versioning.<br/>How error handling affects usability of an API and why RC7807 is so useful.<br/>How to document and API<br/>Security and authentication issues.</p> <p>After the talks we'll head somewhere for drinks.</p> <p>--<br/>Your first time coming to PHPSW?
