The list, which represents the most common vulnerabilities found in web applications, suits very well testers.<br/>But how can developers write more secure applications to prevent these ? What are the security techniques they can use while writing their software to prevent these ?</p> <p>These are hard questions, as evidenced by the increased cyber breaches.<br/>In this talk, we will explore together the new OWASP Top[masked]. Staring from real world examples and breaches, we identify the security controls that developers can use in SDLC to help them to prevent the most common vulnerabilities.</p> <p>Katy Anton is a security professional with a background in software development. In her previous roles she led software development teams and implemented security best practices in software development life cycle. As part of her work she got involved in OWASP Top Ten Proactive Controls project where she joined as project leader and currently leads the OWASP Bristol Chapter.</p> <p>In her current role as Principal Application Security Consultant at CA Technologies | Veracode, Katy works with security teams and software developers around the world and helps them secure their software.</p> <p>- Web Security - The Human Factor<br/>Rob Wilson, Senior PHP Developer at Superdry (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/devtoolboxuk\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/devtoolboxuk</a>)</p> <p>\u201cAn overview of how web developers can protect their applications, their businesses, but most importantly; their sanity. \u201c</p> <p>It will include a brief overview of common mistakes made with web applications that could lead the developer, and/or others to a security faux pas. Some best practices to follow, and some real world examples of where I/others have screwed up.<br/>--</p> <p>BaseKit (<a href=\"http://www.basekit.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.basekit.com/</a>) have kindly offered to host the evening at their office, and as always we'll sort out some ales, lagers, soft drinks and snacks.
