    "description": "<p>In January we present 'New Year, New Topics', a collection of talks on topics we haven't featured much (if at all) at PHPSW.</p> <p>Thanks to BaseKit for kindly hosting us this month.</p> <p>Our talks this month:</p> <p>- Command and (e)mission Control<br/>Barney Hanlon (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/shrikeh\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/shrikeh</a>)</p> <p>Using event dispatchers and command buses in applications is becoming common place, but are we using them in a way that aids understanding? With the rise in popularity of Domain-Driven Design to drive meaning in applications, and our applications becoming increasingly small and \"hexagonal\", the concept of defining the difference between an Event and a Command is becoming more important.</p> <p>This talk explores using command buses and event dispatchers in combination to clearly segregate the structure, and uses an example of how to use these to create clean CQRS-based applications.</p> <p>- HTTP Caching: Improving Performance &amp; Saving the Ice Caps<br/>Phil Sturgeon (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/philsturgeon\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/philsturgeon</a>)</p> <p>HTTP Caching is something many people have heard of, and usually know a bit about but skip implementing in any real way. Browsers are expected to do everything correctly by default, and backend systems don\u2019t bother because Redis Caching is apparently fine... Well it\u2019s not. Balancing real-time information and avoiding making unnecessary requests isn\u2019t a pipe dream, and there are plenty of tools out there to help you get it done right now.<br/>--</p> <p>BaseKit (<a href=\"http://www.basekit.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.basekit.com/</a>) have kindly offered to host the evening at their office, and as always we'll sort out some ales, lagers, soft drinks and snacks. Don't forget to check them out - and if you're looking, they are hiring.</p> <p>As always, a big thanks to our meetup sponsors Ents24 (<a href=\"http://www.ents24.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.ents24.com/</a>), Brightpearl (<a href=\"http://www.brightpearl.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.brightpearl.com/</a>), Meanbee (<a href=\"https://www.meanbee.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meanbee.com/</a>), Deep Blue Sky (<a href=\"http://deepbluesky.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://deepbluesky.com/</a>) &amp; Equiniti (<a href=\"https://equiniticybersecurity.com/careers/\" class=\"linkified\">https://equiniticybersecurity.com/careers/</a>) without whom we wouldn't be able to put on our meetups.</p> <p>Afterwards we'll head to the pub, probably the Volunteer Tavern (<a href=\"http://volunteertavern.co.uk/real-ales\" class=\"linkified\">http://volunteertavern.co.uk/real-ales</a>)!</p> ",
