If you have a talk you'd like to give (lightning or full length), we've got room for a third, so get in touch.\u00a0</p> <p>- <b>The Value Case for Unit Tests</b><br/>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/php-sw/members/39370012\">Dan Ackroyd</a>, Independent C + PHP developer, Imagick maintainer.</p> <p>Do you work at a company where there are not enough unit tests in place and things are constantly breaking? Or maybe you have a client that always wants new features to be delivered as soon as possible, without enough thought about maintaining code.</p> <p>How do you persuade people that Unit Tests should be written? And that by writing them you will improve your code quality and make development be easier? And how many unit tests should you be writing anyway?</p> <p>- <b>Beyond Unit Testing</b><br/>\u00a0 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dantleech\">&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/php-sw/members/104883962\"&gt;Dave Liddament</a>,\u00a0Director and developer at\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.lampbristol.com/\">Lamp Bristol</a>.<a href=\"https://github.com/phpbench/phpbench\">&lt;/a&gt;</p> <p>Unit testing is an essential part of any successful software project, but it's only half the testing story. This talk will examine the other half of the testing story. We'll see why we need more than just unit tests and how to write these extra tests.</p> <p>--</p> <p>&lt;a href=\"http://www.mixrad.io/\"&gt;</a><a href=\"http://www.basekit.com/\">BaseKit</a>\u00a0have kindly offered to host the evening at their office, and as always we'll sort out some ales, lagers, soft drinks and snacks. Don't forget to check them out - and if you're looking, they are hiring.</p> <p>Afterwards we'll head to the pub, probably the\u00a0<a href=\"http://volunteertavern.co.uk/real-ales\">Volunteer Tavern</a>!</p> <p>--</p> <p><a href=\"http://phpsw.uk/events/227424666-profiling-and-benchmarking\">View on the PHPSW website</a></p> ",
