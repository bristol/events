Unfortunately our snappy title &amp; theming department are on holiday this month...</p> <p>Thanks to Brightpearl for kindly hosting us this month.</p> <p>Our talks this month:</p> <p><b>-\u00a0Graphs are Everywhere<br/></b><a href=\"https://twitter.com/choult\">Chris Hoult</a>,\u00a0senior software engineer, speaker, phpberks founder &amp; fount of useless knowledge.</p> <p>No - not charts! Graphs are a data structure that are more than just the nodes and edges they contain: from mapping networks to representing arithmetic, from writing chat-bots to inferring relationships, applying graphs to a problem can quite often provide an elegant solution. In this light-hearted and accessible talk, Chris will cover the basics of graphs as well as go over a few simple but fun examples of this versatile concept.</p> <p><b>-\u00a0Living With Legacy<br/></b><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MPOram\">&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/php-sw/members/101607952/\"&gt;Nigel Dunn</a>, Software Engineer, <a href=\"https://oncorps.io/\">OnCorps</a>.\u00a0<a href=\"https://maydenacademy.co.uk/\">&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.instantiate.co.uk/\"&gt;</a></p> <p>--</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.brightpearl.com/\">Brightpearl</a> have kindly offered to host the evening at their office, and as always we'll sort out some ales, lagers, soft drinks and snacks.
