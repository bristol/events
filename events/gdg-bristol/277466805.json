    "description": "<p>Deploying workloads to GKE is easy, but optimising them to achieve high availability and greater resource efficiency can be challenging. In this workshop we will walk-through practices that can help address these challenges, including configuring container-native load balancing, liveness and readiness probes, and pod-disruption budgets.</p> <p>Tim Berry (Head of Cloud Training, Appsbroker) will provide a quick theory lesson on the concepts we will use to optimise GKE workloads, then as a group we will work through the Qwiklab \u201cGKE Workload Optimization\u201d, getting hands-on with our own GKE clusters in a free (and risk-free) environment. Tim and some other GDG volunteers will be on hand to answer any questions if you get stuck.</p> <p>This is an intermediate workshop and to join you should have some basic experience deploying simple workloads to Kubernetes. In order to participate you will need an account with <a href=\"https://google.qwiklabs.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://google.qwiklabs.com/</a>. You can create an account for free. We will provide a voucher code to launch the lab during the workshop.</p> <p>Please don't RSVP on Meetup!
