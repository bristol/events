In today\u2019s world calculating our heart rate is very easy due to wearable\u2019s available in the market as well as an application that helps us to calculate heart rate. But the question is. Is it accurate? and it is interesting the answer is no. We can argue about the accuracy of a heart rate but it is definitely not interesting. The only way to make calculating your heart rate interesting is by adding augmented reality to it. There are many heart rate monitor applications available. But none of the apps are using augmented reality to make the application more fun and interesting. The following are some of the smart devices in the category of heart rate monitor applications. The cardiac application will make the study of the heart more interesting and it will give accurate heart rate output. There is not a single application that has integrated AR. The app will benefit medical studies.</p> <p>This event is being hosted by GDG Southampton.
