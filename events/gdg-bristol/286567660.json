Come along and say Hi and we'll figure out how we can get back on track supporting each other as Google developers! The venue will likely be central Bristol, hopefully walking distance from most offices or transport links, but we'll pick somewhere nearer the time when we have an idea of numbers.</p> <p>GDGs have moved to a dedicated portal! Who even uses Meetup anymore?! So make sure you RSVP here: [<a href=\"https://gdg.community.dev/events/details/google-gdg-bristol-presents-lunchtime-social-reanimating-the-chapter/.](https://gdg.community.dev/events/details/google-gdg-bristol-presents-lunchtime-social-reanimating-the-chapter/\" class=\"linkified\">https://gdg.community.dev/events/details/google-gdg-bristol-presents-lunchtime-social-reanimating-the-chapter/.](https://gdg.community.dev/events/details/google-gdg-bristol-presents-lunchtime-social-reanimating-the-chapter/</a>.)</p> ",
