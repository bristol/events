    "description": "<p>In this workshop, you will learn how to prepare the Spark interactive shell on a Google Cloud Dataproc cluster, create a training dataset for machine learning using Spark, develop a logistic regression machine learning model using Spark, and evaluate the predictive behaviour of a machine learning model using Spark on Google Cloud Datalab.</p> <p>Together with Goran Minov (Technical Project Manager, RBH and Co-Organiser, GDG London), you will cover the basics on how to implement logistic regression using a machine learning library for Apache Spark running on a Google Cloud Dataproc cluster to develop a model for data from a multivariable dataset.</p> <p>To join this workshop you should have basic Linux sysadmin skills and some familiarity with Machine Learning basics. Experience with Dataproc will be beneficial but is not essential.</p> <p>This event is being hosted by GDG London.
