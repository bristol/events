As the first of our meetups taking place entirely online, it'll be even more informal than usual but will still include a feature presentation and a chance to socialise (with guaranteed safe physical distance) with other technology enthusiasts. The meeting will take place via Zoom and a link will be sent out to join on the day. You can join through your browser - no account signup or software installation is required. You do have to bring your own pizza and drinks though!</p> ",
