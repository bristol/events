    "description": "<p>We're pleased to announce our first online virtual meetup! As the first of our meetups taking place entirely online, it'll be even more informal than usual but will still include a feature presentation and a chance to socialise (with guaranteed safe physical distance) with other technology enthusiasts. In this first virtual meetup, Tim Berry will take us through building a big data pipeline with Pub/Sub, Dataflow and BigQuery, then using it to flag naughty words in fake tweets. The meeting will take place via Zoom (sorry Google! It gives us a few more features than Hangouts). Bring your own pizza and drinks!</p> ",
