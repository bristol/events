But separating the opportunities from the hype, and balancing the risks against the rewards, is hard. We know there\u2019s so much we could do \u2013 but how do we decide whether we should do it?</p> <p>We\u2019ll be looking at practical AI applications as well as debating complex issues, and discussing the value social scientists can bring to AI project teams. Aimed at both subject newcomers and experts from diverse professional and personal backgrounds, this event will be in our usual interactive style, wrapped up with friendly networking.</p> <p>This event is brought to you by the Bristol team at One HealthTech, a global, grassroots community that supports and promotes better openness, inclusion, kindness and diversity in health innovation; and Mundy &amp; Anson, organisers of the Anthropology &amp; Technology Conference which took place in Bristol on 3 October 2019.</p> <p>We\u2019ll distill some of the discussions and themes from the Anthropology &amp; Technology Conference, where the role of social scientists in helping develop socially-responsible AI will be explored. Hear from speakers ranging from companies, policy influencers and technology experts working in this area, followed by a panel Q&amp;A and open discussion.</p> <p>IS THIS FOR ME?</p> <p>This will be a wide-ranging and practical event aimed at a range of attendees. We\u2019re aiming to navigate some of the grey areas in this complex field and help further everyone\u2019s understanding. The event may therefore appeal to people from a range of professional backgrounds including (but not limited to): clinical and non-clinical healthcare professionals, social scientists, academics, creatives with an interest in ethical AI, start-ups, technologists, product managers and developers.</p> <p>AGENDA</p> <p>2.30pm - Registration</p> <p>2.45pm - Prompt start &amp; welcome by Sally Powell, Hub Lead, One HealthTech Bristol</p> <p>Introductory talk: Dawn Walter, Mundy &amp; Anson \u2013 Why you need social scientists in your technology team</p> <p>Lightning talks:</p> <p>Laura Sobola, Elucidata \u2013 AI in medicine: Informed consent and unintended consequences<br/>Ellie Foreman, Automation Fellow for the South West Creative Technology Network \u2013 Designing conversational AI for emotional support.</p> <p>3.25pm - Networking, tea and cake</p> <p>4.00pm - Panel discussion and Q&amp;A</p> <p>Anne Marie Cunningham, GP and Associate Medical Director for Primary Care, NHS Wales Informatics Service.
