Mentoring is a simple but powerful way to support underrepresented groups in HealthTech, pay it forward, and generally develop your career.</p> <p>** As well as joining on Meetup, please get your ticket via Eventbrite <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2CqR956\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/2CqR956</a>. If you only see a small number of attendees on Meetup it's because it's not our main platform **</p> <p>Join One HealthTech in Bristol for an interactive evening as we find out how mentoring makes a difference to both individuals and organisations. We'll also launch our own mentor matching activity.</p> <p>Discover how you can be your own cheerleader and how to approach a mentor. Learn the dos and don\u2019ts around forming a mentoring relationship. We\u2019ll also quiz a bunch of people who\u2019ve been a mentor or mentee.
