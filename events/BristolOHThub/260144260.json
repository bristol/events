It is the alteration (modulation) of the nerve activity by delivering electrical signals to a target area. Neuromodulation is currently used to treat and enhance the quality of life in individuals who suffer severe chronic illness due to persistent pain, spasticity, movement disorders, epilepsy, ischaemia, cardiac, bowel and bladder dysfunction, spinal injury, visual, auditory and specific psychiatric disorders...</p> <p>What if we could replace drugs and their countless side effects with bioelectronic implants?
