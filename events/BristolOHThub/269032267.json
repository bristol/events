The money can cover just about anything, including but not limited to child/other care, taxis if you\u2019re not able-bodied, trains if you live out in the countryside, a live captioner, recording of the event or loss of earnings if you have a side job along your studies. If you feel it\u2019s a barrier, we agree too.
