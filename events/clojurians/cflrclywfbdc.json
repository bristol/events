We can go through your code with you and offer advice.</p> <p>Any type of project is welcome, whether it be an exercise from a beginners' textbook or something crazy and ambitious like a game. Or maybe you just want an extra pair of eyes on that 4clojure problem you're working on. Or you want to upgrade your emacs setup. A bunch of devs will be here to help.</p> <p>Food and drinks will be provided, so see you there!</p> <p>Note, just in case you missed it: this meetup will be hosted at the Oracle office in central Bristol, rather than the usual location.</p> ",
