We will be alternating them with talks, hoping to create a theme that connects the two from here on.</p> <p>Theme: Building a classifier from scratch in Go</p> <p>This task is based off the fantastic talk by James where he showed us how to build a classifier from scratch.</p> <p>On top of this theme we encourage you to bring your own problems and we can work through them together. We encourage you to treat this as office hours; as in pop in any time if you get stuck, ask us questions and we'll do our best to help you out. We can use breakout rooms if you fancy working as a pair/group.</p> <p>Plan:<br/>- 18:00-18:05 - short introduction to the repository<br/>- 18:05-onwards - work on classifier (breakout rooms if needed)</p> <p>\ud83d\udce3 We are looking for help with organising! If you or anyone you know would like to help, give us a shout!</p> <p>\ud83d\udce3Help us grow! JetBrains offers free licences to meet-ups with attendance greater than 30. If we can reach this, we will apply and be handing it out as a prize at events.</p> ",
