More recently he has \"gone legit\" and now works as a Regular Software Developer in a Regular Company. He found Go about 4 years ago, and it has made him a happier human.</p> <p>There are a lot of different ways people try to figure out whether you're the right person for a job working with Go. Nick will talk about his experiences interviewing for a bunch of different companies, from tech giants to startups. We'll cover getting an interview, what to expect at interview, what to focus on, and how to do well with different kinds of coding and algorithm tests. As a good developer with no experience in the mainstream of the industry he had to learn a lot of these lessons the hard way, which he hopes will provide an interesting perspective for both people looking for their next job, and people looking for their next hire. Oh, and he ended up getting a great job, don't worry!</p> <p>\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Pedro Costa - Event sourcing at UW: How we leverage event queues to handle state</p> <p>Pedro joined UW 3 years ago, initially as a Software Engineer before stepping up into a Senior Software Engineering position.
