A zoom link will be added closer to the date.</p> <p>Speakers:</p> <p>\ud83d\udde3 Nick White - Using Fyne to create beautiful GUIs in idiomatic Go</p> <p>Nick is a free software loving developer who has worked in a variety of weird jobs creating tools for academics in the humanities, currently working for the University of Oxford. He found Go about 4 years ago, and it has made him a happier human.</p> <p>Nick will talk about using the Fyne toolkit to create native cross-platform desktop and mobile interfaces in pure Go.</p> <p>We will walk through an example of adding a GUI in Fyne to an existing Go command line program, showing off a variety of widgets and customisation that's possible. We'll talk about the pros and cons of using a toolkit that has been built from the ground up for Go, as opposed to bindings for more well-known toolkits like Qt, GTK or Tk.</p> <p>\u23f0 Schedule:</p> <p>* 18:00-18:05 intro/welcome<br/>* 18:05-18:35 first speaker<br/>* 18:55-19:00 farewell/next event info</p> <p>\ud83d\udce3 We are looking for help with organising!
