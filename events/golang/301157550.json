He lives just outside of Bristol in the Chew Valley with his wife and 1 year old daughter, and spends his free time completing the couch to 5k every year, relapsing, and obsessing over cooking.</p> <p>Dan will cover why Holland &amp; Barrett are moving from using NodeJS in their middleware to Golang services, and some similarities between the two languages for others thinking of making the jump.</p> <p>\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Ed Crewe - Why do I use Go?</p> <p>Ed is a long time member of Bristol Gophers, having given talks before, also asking many amazing questions. He works at the Postgres company, EDB, on their cloud Postgres AI product.</p> <p>Like any language Go has its critics, it is good to check out what features, idioms and patterns are seen as an issue by them. To understand and answer any problems with respect to your own usage of Go.<br/>This talk attempts to do that.</p> <p>\u23f0 Schedule (possibly):</p> <p>* 18:00-18:15 welcome/pizza/intro<br/>* 18:15-18:45 first speaker<br/>* 18:45-18:50 small break<br/>* 18:50-19:20 second speaker<br/>* 19:15-19:30 farewell/next event info</p> <p>\u2764\ufe0f Sponsors</p> <p>* AJ Bell (venue)<br/>* Formula Recruitment (food/drinks)</p> <p>\ud83d\udccd - Pivot+Mark</p> ",
