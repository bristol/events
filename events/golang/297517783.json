Thomas loves tech, and is good at solving problems. He cares about his work in software development. He's helped Ne\u00adarLunar grow by turning tricky tasks into good, quick software. He knows a lot about different types of technology and how to use them today</p> <p>\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Alexander Jophus - A Rust vs Go comparison</p> <p>This is a quick talk on rust vs go, the benefits of both, the drawbacks of both.
