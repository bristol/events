He has been working primarily in go for about five years. Outside of work, he spends his time running around the countryside with his dog, and raising his two year old child.</p> <p>\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f TBC</p> <p>\u23f0 Schedule (possibly):</p> <p>* 18:00-18:15 welcome/pizza/intro<br/>* 18:15-18:45 first speaker<br/>* 18:45-18:50 small break<br/>* 18:50-19:20 second speaker<br/>* 19:15-19:30 farewell/next event info</p> <p>\u2764\ufe0f Sponsors</p> <p>* Tumelo (venue)<br/>* Formula Recruitment (food/drinks)</p> <p>\ud83d\udccd - Runway East</p> ",
