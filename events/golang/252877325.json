There is almost always more than one answer and it can be tricky to decide what will work best.</p> <p>Should I keep all my files under one directory or should I split them up? How should I divide my code and into what packages? Can I write object-oriented code in Go? Why do some projects have a cmd directory and what is the advantage of that?</p> <p>This talk will aim to answer those questions and give you an overview of common design patterns and best practices to make your projects testable, maintainable and easy to understand.</p> <p>20:05 Break</p> <p>20:15 Lightning talk - \"Go tooling\" - Ben King</p> <p>We're looking for a lightning talk (anywhere between 5-15 mins, on any subject related to Go or programming). If you'd like to give one let us know! :)</p> <p>20:30 Head home or continue your conversations at the pub</p> ",
