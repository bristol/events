Lively, provocative and informative, The Power of Not Thinking explains the root meaning of \"embodied\" knowledge in a way that has implications for business executives and policy makers working in any sphere. If you are handling Big Data, or hoping technology can solve your problems, you should read this\u2014and learn the power of anthropology to show how our entire ecosystem works, including our bodies\" \u2014 Gillian Tett, anthropologist and Chair Editorial Board, Editor-at-large, US, The Financial Times.</p> <p>Check out Simon's 2019 keynote: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv4URKq9kbQ\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv4URKq9kbQ</a></p> <p>ABOUT SIMON ROBERTS<br/>An anthropologist, Simon considers himself to have the best job in the world: researching the emerging frontiers of people and technology and trying to land that understanding with impact in complex environments.

We help our clients decide what to do now and what to do next.</p> <p>Simon has long been connected with the world of business anthropology. He writes and speaks widely on anthropology, ethnography, and technology, and his work has been covered by Bloomberg, The Financial Times, Wall Street Journal, BBC Radio 4, Quartz and The Daily Telegraph.
