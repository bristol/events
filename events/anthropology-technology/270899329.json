    "description": "<p>We're in conversation with Ivana Bartoletti, Technical Director, Privacy, Deloitte and Women Leading in AI Network, Co Founder, about her book, An Artificial Revolution: On Power, Politics and AI. Ivana is also speaking at the 2020 Anthropology + Technology conference on Friday 9 October: <a href=\"https://www.anthtechconf.co.uk/2020speakers\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.anthtechconf.co.uk/2020speakers</a>.</p> <p>AI is not simply a technology. As Ivana shows, it is power, it is political, and it is gendered. While AI has unrivalled potential to transform both our present and our future, it is also related to oppression. But there is a way out and that involves asking searching questions about how we govern the use, research, an deployment of AI. Ivana's book is a short, passionate call to arms to avoid sleepwalking into a future written by algorithms which encode racist, sexist and classist biases into our daily lives. She urges us to get involved in the debates which will shape our collective future.</p> <p>Our interview with Ivana will continue the conversation we had on the Anthropology + Technology Conference blog: <a href=\"https://www.anthtechconf.co.uk/news/an-artificial-revolution\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.anthtechconf.co.uk/news/an-artificial-revolution</a></p> <p>AGENDA<br/>18:30 - Welcome and introduction<br/>18:35 - 19:05 - In conversation with Ivana Bartoletti<br/>19:05 - 19:30 - Q&amp;A</p> <p>ABOUT IVANA BARTOLETTI<br/>Ivana is the Technical Director at Deloitte, and helps businesses harness the data they hold.
