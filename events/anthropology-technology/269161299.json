In the meantime, grab your spot and save the date!</p> <p>**Please note there is a small charge to cover venue hire costs and to reduce no-shows. Our speakers give up their time for free to deliver talks and it's disappointing for them and us if people don't show up. Thanks for your understanding.</p> <p>// About FiveAI //</p> <p>FiveAI is a UK startup, with offices here in Bristol, developing the software to power shared, self-driving vehicle services in Europe. They are developing driverless car technology with a strategy to build a fleet of shared vehicles.</p> <p>Europe has a lot of urban density, roads that are less likely to follow grid patterns, and road names are very often the opposite of clearly marked. These factors make Europe a hard problem to tackle in terms of self-driving cars, one that FiveAI is trying to solve.</p> <p>As Stan Boland, co-founder and CEO of FiveAI, has said: 'Shared, self-driving vehicle services promise a better way for people to get around. We\u2019ll be working with forward-thinking partners to make these services a reality in European urban environments.\"</p> ",
