(so make sure you're there just before to grab a drink)</p> <p>This time we are having a more casual meetup in the King Street Brew house pub. You can purchase food at the Brew House however there will be NO FOOD provided this time, but SWMobile will pick up the tab for a few drinks at the bar instead. (We have a event room booked downstairs)</p> <p>So feel free to just come for a drink and socialize/network or watch the full keynote.</p> <p>RSVP's will close on the Sunday 2nd.</p> ",
