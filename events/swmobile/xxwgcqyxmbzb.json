(Mez Pahlan)<br/>This talk is aimed at Kotlin newbies that have a good understanding of Java but haven't yet dipped their toes in. It might also be useful for people that have started Kotlin but have hit a road block and yearn for the old days where being verbose was a good thing. It collects my experience as I convert two apps into Kotlin as part of the Kotlin Knights study groups.</p> <p>- Trunk Based Development (Matthew Robbins)<br/>What are the advantages from moving from feature branching to committing to master?</p> <p>- FloFrame: a 'No code' mobile app development platform (Raman Mistry)</p> <p>- Are we \u2018Agile\u2019 yet? (Sam Allen)</p> <p>Finally we are really excited to be trying out a new venue this month at Framework on Kings Street. This is a brand new co-working and events space right in the heart of Bristol. It's directly opposite the Royal Navy Volunteer pub.
