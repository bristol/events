So we've decided to cancel the event and turn it into Christmas drinks ... hope you'll all join us.</p> <p>We're going to be heading to Colston Yard for 7pm so hope to see you there.</p> <p>Hopefully we'll be able to reschedule the 'Realtime' event for the new year.</p> <p>Mobile is all about 'the moment' and doing things now, not later. With that in mind this talk night is geared around real time communication.\u00a0</p> <p>We've lined up a speaker from\u00a0Pusher.com who will also be covering the beer tab at the bar afterwards. :)\u00a0</p> <p>Give us a shout if you'd like to show case/present an app you've worked on with real time communications and are open to speaking about your experiences (good and bad). I'm thinking mainly this would be from a dev focus, however if any UI/UX peoples have perspective of designing for real time that would be good too.\u00a0</p> <p>As always please only RSVP yes if you can make it :)\u00a0</p> ",
