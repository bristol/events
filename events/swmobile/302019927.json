    "description": "<p>First off, apologies for the long gap since our last in-person meetup. Rest assured, we are still active. The current organising team has just been caught up with life, family, work, and other commitments.</p> <p>We're eager to connect with members interested in contributing to the group, whether by giving a talk, hosting events, helping organize, or simply generating fresh ideas.</p> <p>Like previous socials, there are no scheduled talks this time. We have a reserved area in a pub, perfect for engaging conversations with fellow members. As is our tradition, and while the kitty lasts, the first drink is on SWmobile!</p> <p>If you are a first-time member or don\u2019t know anyone and would prefer to pre-meet so you can arrive with others, please send us a message via meetup.com, and we\u2019ll arrange it.</p> <p>For those interested in speaking at future events, please fill out the CFP form at [<a href=\"http://cfp.swmobile.org](http://cfp.swmobile.org\" class=\"linkified\">http://cfp.swmobile.org](http://cfp.swmobile.org</a>).</p> <p>We look forward to seeing you there!</p> ",
