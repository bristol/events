If you're unfamiliar with the concept, this means each talk will be only 10 minutes long. It should be a really fun evening, with lots of speakers and a wide range of topics - something for everyone! Here's our list of speakers:</p> <p>\u2022 <b>Paul Hudson</b>:\u00a0UIStackView For Fun and Profit</p> <p>\u2022 <b>Karl Nosworthy</b>: 10 Top Software Engineering Concepts and Processes</p> <p>\u2022 <b>James Frost</b>: Cocoapods vs Carthage: iOS Dependency Management</p> <p>\u2022 <b>James-Lee</b>: I &lt;3 Swift</p> <p>\u2022 <b>Sam Davies</b>:\u00a0Functional Reactive Programming (FRP FTW!)</p> <p>\u2022 <b>Chris Phin</b>: Personality and Playfulness in App Design</p> ",
