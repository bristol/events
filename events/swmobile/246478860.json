We\u2019ve decided to go for a social rather than talk night mainly as the main organisers are either recovering from illness, starting new job or moving house. So we figured let's ease in to 2018 gently and get together for a chat about the kinds of speakers,talks and events you want to see in 2018. Please come with suggestions! \u2022 What to bring<br/>Yourself (and guest if you like)</p> <p>\u2022 Important to know<br/>As usual we\u2019ll cover a drink or two but we recommend grabbing a bite to eat before hand.</p> ",
