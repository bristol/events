Android Things lets you build professional, mass-market products on a trusted platform, without previous knowledge of embedded system design. IoT devices need testing too. This talk will give an introduction to the new Android Things APIs, also how to architect to keep your codebase clean and your IoT devices solid. The second half of the talk will be a deeper dive into controlling Android Things peripherals. We'll explain what are user drivers, how they work, how to use them, and most importantly: how you can create and test a new driver from scratch that can be used for Android Things to interact with new peripherals.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Talk 2: Exploring Firebase for iOS by Daniele Pietrobelli\u00a0</b></p> <p>The story of a simple app using CoreML and Firebase to observe reality in real time.</p> <p>Timetable:\u00a0</p> <p>\u2022 18:00-18:15 - organisers/volunteers arrive</p> <p>\u2022 18:30 doors open / pizza arrive\u00a0</p> <p>\u2022 19:00 Intro by SWmobile organiser (thank sponsors, venue admin i.e toilets, fire exits)</p> <p>\u2022 19:10 Talk one</p> <p>\u2022 19:[masked]min comfort break</p> <p>\u2022 19:50 Talk two</p> <p>\u2022 20:20 finish up and head to the pub</p> <p>\u2022 20:30 Volunteers leave after helping tidy up</p> ",
