We're hoping to run a lightning talks night before the end of the year but thought it would be ideal to have a social first to get some ideas percolating. Plus at Kongs, we have a chance to play some retro arcade games.</p> <p>While the majority of COVID issues seem to be behind us if you're feeling unwell please stay at home - there will be more events!</p> <p>We'll cover your 1st drink but you'll probably want some food either before or at Kongs (<a href=\"https://kongsbars.co.uk/\" class=\"linkified\">https://kongsbars.co.uk/</a>).</p> <p>If you have any questions or concerns please do get in touch with one of the organisers via meetup or ask in the SWmobile slack. Look forward to seeing you!</p> <p>P.s If you have ideas of talks or types of events you'd like to see and you cannot make this event please reply.</p> ",
