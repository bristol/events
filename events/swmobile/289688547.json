A couple of months later in July, we hosted the first talk night and the rest is history!</p> <p>We missed the 10-year anniversary while the group was on hiatus after Covid so we're gonna go all in for this 10+1 anniversary.</p> <p>This is a placeholder for the event and we don't have specifics yet but I'm sure it'll be an awesome and informal night with members and speakers past and present.</p> <p>Save the date!</p> ",
