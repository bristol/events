Thanks</p> <p>We often think of our smartphones as mini computers but they are more than that. They are mini computers that have to endure some of the strangest and most constantly changing connectivity of any computer. Have you ever wondered how all this magic really works and if your apps could handle it all better? In this meetup we'll be looking at how phones connect to the internet and what we as developers, designers etc should know about that to make what we do better.\u00a0</p> <p>We'll be hearing from Chris Green all about 2/3/4/5G and WiFi and how they actually work and what you need to know about them. We'll also being hearing from Rick Chapman with \"Mobile data versus the web - the rematch\"\u00a0</p> <p>Normal timetable.</p> <p>\u2022 18:30 doors open / food and drinks provided</p> <p>\u2022 19:00 Intros</p> <p>\u2022 19:10 Chris Green talk</p> <p>\u2022 19:[masked]min comfort break</p> <p>\u2022 18:05 Rick Chapman talk</p> <p>\u2022 20:50 finish up and head to the pub</p> ",
