See the event photo for where to find the door.</p> <p>\u2022 Important to know<br/>Venue security requirements means we need to have full names of all attendees, so each attendee will need to register separately rather than as '+1's.</p> <p>RSVPs will close on the Friday 3rd at 4pm as Monday is a Bank Holiday.</p> ",
