    "description": "<p>Join us for our 5th annual Xmas Social where we skip the talks and have an evening of socialising/networking/chatting over a couple of drinks.</p> <p>As has become tradition SWmobile will cover the first round, when you arrive just find an organiser or volunteer (the people in the SWmobile t-shirts) and they will help you get a drink!</p> <p>If you've never been to a Meetup before and (or just) fancy meeting up with someone first before going in, please feel free to get in touch and we can arrange a casual meetup before the main event.</p> <p>Given potentially limited space at this time of year please only RSVP if you are definitely planning to attend.</p> <p>Location : King St Brewhouse</p> ",
