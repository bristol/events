    "description": "<p>We have had a lot of new members since moving to meetup.com, just over 150 now, but not so many events, so its time for a social meetup, so that some of those new members can get to know the Bristol Python community, and each other :-)</p> <p>We also aim to canvas for ideas as to what new members want from the group, and hopefully recruit some new speakers for the next get together, as a talks session.</p> <p>So three of the organisers should be in attendence - we are looking forward to catching up with some old faces and new Pythonistas.</p> ",
