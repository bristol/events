Note: registration via external site.</p> <p>Register at <a href=\"https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_a_nuYR1xT86TGIB2wp9B1g\" class=\"linkified\">https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_a_nuYR1xT86TGIB2wp9B1g</a></p> <p>*What is MLOps, and how can it help me work from home?*</p> <p>MLOps is the intersection of three disciplines: software engineering, DevOps and machine learning. MLOps refers to the entire end-to-end lifecycle of getting models from lab to live where they can start delivering value.</p> <p>What do software engineers and DevOps need to learn about machine learning to ensure that it can be integrated into their dev &amp; deployment pipelines? What do data scientists and ML engineers need to learn about DevOps, model deployment and monitoring to ensure they can effectively deploy their work without racking up technical debt? And now that working from home is fast becoming the new normal, how can MLOps help my team stay efficient when asynchronous collaboration is needed, something our software engineering and DevOps friends have already mastered?</p> <p>Speaker: Luke Marsden, Founder &amp; CEO at Dotscience<br/>Bio: Luke is a hacker and entrepreneur. Deeply involved in the early Docker and Kubernetes days, he's now working on bringing DevOps best practices to ML with MLOps.</p> <p>20m open Q&amp;A / discussion</p> ",
