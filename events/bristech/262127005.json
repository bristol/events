    "description": "<p>TL;DR: IT'S NOT AT THE ENGINE SHED. We'll be having a social at the Watershed. We'll put some money behind the bar.</p> <p>We have a break from talks for August, so we thought it'd be good this year to have a social. There are always good chats over pizza and drinks after the regular monthly events, so this is an opportunity to talk at greater length without the inconvenience of being shooed out of the venue.</p> <p>We won't be providing pizza at this event, but we will put the normal cost of a Bristech monthly meetup behind the bar. The Watershed does lovely food at a reasonable price :-)</p> ",
