What challenges are related to data versioning and how to overcome these. What are the benefits of using Git and data codification as a foundation of data versioning? And how open data versioning tools can enable an open MLOps ecosystem instead of closed end-to-end ML platforms.</p> <p>Dmitry is a creator of open-source tool Data Version Control - DVC.org - or Git for data. He is a former data scientist at Microsoft with Ph.D. in Computer Science. Now Dmitry is working on tools for machine learning and data versioning as a Co-Founder and CEO of Iterative.AI in San Francisco, CA.</p> <p>Please feel free to drop some questions you may have beforehand into our slack channel (<a href=\"https://bit.ly/33wDUf1\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/33wDUf1</a>)</p> ",
