There is a lack of clarity around key elements: Product Roadmaps and Planning, the Machine Learning Lifecycle, Project and Product Management, Release Management, and Maintenance.</p> <p>In this talk, I will cover a framework-specific to Machine Learning products. I will discuss the improvements businesses can expect to see from a repeatable process. I will also cover the concept of monetization and integrating machine learning into the business model.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>I am an applied data scientist and I teach companies to monetize machine learning.
