    "description": "<p># Jacob Tomlinson - Writing GPU code in Python is easier today than ever!</p> <p>I joined NVIDIA in 2019 and I was brand new to GPU development. In that time, I\u2019ve gotten to grips with the fundamentals of writing accelerated code in Python. I was amazed to discover that I didn\u2019t need to learn C++ and I didn\u2019t need new development tools. Writing GPU code in Python is easier today than ever, and in this tutorial, I will share what I\u2019ve learned and how you can get started with accelerating your code.</p> <p>Once we\u2019ve written a bit of GPU code we will look at some open source Python libraries that are part of the RAPIDS suite of tools. These libraries follow familiar APIs from the PyData ecosystem for working with Dataframes, ND-Arrays and doing statistics and machine learning, but under the hood they\u2019ve been rewritten to run on NVIDIA GPUs giving large performance gains.</p> <p>## About Jacob<br/>TBC</p> <p># Panel discussion with...</p> <p>TBC</p> <p># Bristech Meetup Sponsors 2021</p> <p>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure - <a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/uk/cloud/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.oracle.com/uk/cloud/</a></p> <p>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is an IaaS that delivers high-performance computing power to run cloud-native and enterprise company's IT workloads.
