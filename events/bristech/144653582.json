    "description": "<p>Another month, another Bristech outing and this month we have two fresh talks on the perennially popular topic of Javascript: Tom Hallam (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Ftomhallam%3Frefsrc%3Demail&amp;sig=32e1e91727e854ea9b90f86b8487aa43362d422e&amp;uid=1600909274&amp;iid=37c35333-2983-4329-96fd-2c5607a7159d&amp;nid=6+279&amp;t=1\">@tomhallam</a>)\u00a0is going to chat to you about the possibilities of computer vision with Node.js and various open source computer vision libraries in his talk entitled \"Giving Javascript a pair of eyes\". In the second talk, Jack Franklin (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FJack_Franklin%3Frefsrc%3Demail&amp;sig=2724f225e981e5fe5ff64221a0a7fd669ac14f95&amp;uid=1600909274&amp;iid=37c35333-2983-4329-96fd-2c5607a7159d&amp;nid=6+279&amp;t=1\">@Jack_Franklin</a>)\u00a0is going to wax lyrical about some of the enterprise javascript frameworks out there including GruntJS and EmberJS in his talk entitled \"The New Era of JS\". It will certainly prove to be an interesting evening!</p> <p>As ever, we will have beer (on tap) and food; this month we are foregoing the pizza and opting for some veggie tacos from a local Bristol vendor \"El Greengo's Tacos\" (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ElgreengoSimon\">@ElgreengoSimon</a>)\u00a0so Mexican hats are compulsory ;)</p> ",
