It turns out to have several useful properties that were apparently not noticed for centuries, and to have a connection with 21st Century AI.</p> <p>// About Miranda<br/>Miranda Mowbray is an honorary lecturer at Bristol University, where she helped to set up the centre for doctoral training in Interactive AI. She is a member of the advisory council for the Open Rights Group, and an affiliate scholar of Penn State \u200bUniversity's Pilotlab. Her PhD is in algebra, from London University.</p> <p>// Panelists: George Dunlop</p> <p>// About George<br/>George is a fellow of the Quantum Technology Enterprise Centre at the University of Bristol and co-founder of Quantum Dice, a start-up developing secure, unbiased quantum random number generators. He holds a masters in Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Oxford.</p> ",
