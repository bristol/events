There are specific features that should not be compromised, such as tool flexibility, scalability and deployment.<br/>-Buying an off-the-shelf solution is a fast, flexible and cost-effective option, but may not always be the right choice.<br/>-There is a checklist of options and a standard framework for ML Ops that can be used to help organizations evaluate what an ML Ops platform needs to accomplish and take into account.</p> <p>Abstract:</p> <p>As organizations begin to test out machine learning use cases and develop models, ML teams need to be thinking long-term. How will they deploy, operate, and manage models once developed? Machine learning has specific operational needs that need to be supported within existing SDLC processes. Doing so often begins with a fundamental question: should I build or buy a machine learning management platform to operate my ML lifecycle?</p> <p>Determining whether to build or buy a machine learning management platform will drastically impact the effectiveness of an organization\u2019s investment in ML and their competitive standing in its industry.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Diego Oppenheimer is co-founder and CEO of Algorithmia. Previously, he designed, managed, and shipped some of Microsoft\u2019s most used data analysis products including Excel, Power Pivot, SQL Server, and Power BI. He holds a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Information Systems and a Master\u2019s degree in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics from Carnegie Mellon University.</p> <p>Please feel free to drop some questions you may have beforehand into our slack channel (<a href=\"https://bit.ly/33wDUf1\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/33wDUf1</a>)</p> ",
