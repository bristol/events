The palette of options for tooling to help developing, training and deploying ML has exploded in the last few years. Which ones to use? Which ones will become the de facto standards and continue integrating more features? The reality is that nobody has completely nailed the journey end to end yet. Bristech MLOps will be the perfect event to hear about the latest tooling and have the opportunity to dig deeper through follow-up sessions where speakers will run demos, mini workshops and Q&amp;A sessions in small groups.\u201d - Jose Navarro, ML Infrastructure Engineer, Cookpad, UK</p> <p>Follow @Bristech #BristechMLOps</p> <p><a href=\"https://mlops.bris.tech\" class=\"linkified\">https://mlops.bris.tech</a></p> ",
