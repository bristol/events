They typically posses Confluence pages, Word docs, a mass of emails and the legal contracts that underpin their business. Combine this with the vast amount of unstructured text on the web and you have to ask the question if you\u2019re making informed decisions. This talk shows a way of summarising the information out there to help you find what you need. There won\u2019t be any academia it\u2019s hard statements, just practical applied NLP for the everyday software developer.</p> <p>// ABOUT DAN</p> <p>Dan is an independent Big Data Technical Architect. He has led the development of a Hadoop-as-a-Service offering and built software streaming frameworks long before the rise of Apache Spark and Storm. He\u2019s well versed in the knowledge domain building applications on RDF and SPARQL collapsing many systems of information into 360 views of a customer from both structured and unstructured data.</p> ",
