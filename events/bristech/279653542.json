Its a DataFrame library that brings exploratory data analysis closer to the lessons learned in database research.</p> <p>CPU's today's come with many cores and with their superscalar designs and SIMD registers allow for even more parallelism. Polars is written from the ground up to fully utilize the CPU's of this generation.</p> <p>Besides blazingly fast algorithms, cache efficient memory layout and multi-threading, it consists of a lazy query engine, allowing Polars to do several optimizations that may improve query time and memory usage.</p> <p>Read more:</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/pola-rs/polars\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/pola-rs/polars</a> <a href=\"https://www.ritchievink.com/blog/2021/02/28/i-wrote-one-of-the-fastest-dataframe-libraries/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.ritchievink.com/blog/2021/02/28/i-wrote-one-of-the-fastest-dataframe-libraries/</a></p> <p># About Ritchie<br/><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ritchievink/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/ritchievink/</a></p> <p># Panel discussion with...<br/>TBC</p> <p># Bristech Meetup Sponsors 2021</p> <p>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure - <a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/uk/cloud/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.oracle.com/uk/cloud/</a></p> <p>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is an IaaS that delivers high-performance computing power to run cloud-native and enterprise company's IT workloads.
