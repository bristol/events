In this talk, we\u2019ll see what makes Clojure a great language for coding creative projects such as visualisations, games, synthesisers and web sites.</p> <p>We\u2019ll start with a short explanation of Clojure\u2019s syntax before diving into some live coding. Absolute beginners and seasoned experts are all welcome!</p> <p>Matt Thompson is an EngD researcher working with Sysemia Ltd in Bristol to develop the next generation of interactive, procedurally generated stories for computer games. His interests include making music, coding in odd languages, and spending time trying to match parentheses.</p> ",
