    "description": "<p>// Michael Tinning - Data in the World of Wind Energy</p> <p>Since the installation of the first wind farm in 1980, Wind Energy has grown from a wacky idea pursued by hippies and idealists to a global market forecasted to be worth over $130B in 2023, with an installed capacity approaching 60GW (that's 125 million homes). This explosive growth has produced huge volumes of data and along with it some interesting technical challenges. This talk dives into this exciting world and reveals why it takes more than a fancy algorithm to get the most value out of a wind farm.</p> <p>// About Michael<br/>Michael is an experienced application software engineer and has spent his career building simulation and modelling platforms and user interfaces in the renewables and aerospace industries. Although a seasoned software professional, his engineering background allows him to quickly understand complex problems and provide innovative solutions. He is also an experienced consultant having led large teams to deliver high-profile projects to the financial services sector.</p> <p>Michael and Philip founded Simmovation Ltd in 2018 before joining with Staffan to found BitBloom in 2019.</p> <p>// Panel discussion with Laurence Watson</p> <p>//About Laurence<br/>Laurence is co-founder and CEO of Treebeard Technologies, a software company making tools for data scientists. He was previously a data scientist at Carbon Tracker, a financial think-tank and Sandbag, an NGO focused on carbon markets. He has a degree in physics from the University of Cambridge and an MSc in Energy Systems from UCL.</p> ",
