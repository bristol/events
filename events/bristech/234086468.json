    "description": "<p>// Dan Cook - Visualising Geospatial Big Data</p> <p>A talk showing how you can connect the Hadoop Ecosystem to Elasticsearch and visualise geospatial Big Data with Kibana. From data set to world heat maps and other cool visualisations.</p> <p>Getting your raw data logs into Hadoop, performing joins with interesting reference data and getting everything into Elasticsearch to visualise with Kibana. We want processing times in minutes not days.</p> <p>We will also cover why the geohash makes your geospatial queries amazing and its utilisation in Kibana and Elasticsearch.</p> <p>// About Dan<br/>Dan doesn't know whether to describe himself as a dev, architect or team lead and has been doing a blend of all 3 roles on Big Data projects over the past few years. Although he did have a short break last year to have fun building a web app! When he's not coding, he can either be found in the pub or crawling very slowly up a hill on a bicycle.</p> <p>// Andrew Grimes - Design mortality - negotiating a longer life for digital ideas</p> <p>It isn\u2019t really that difficult to come up with a design idea or even to bring it to life. The difficult part is launching that life into the world and then sustaining it. Design ideas die in translation, or because of changes (in the context of use, in technologies or the competitive landscape) and for a million other reasons. Our work is often obsolete within years or perhaps months. As implementors, the best we can hope for is to negotiate as long a life as possible for our digital creations. In this talk, we\u2019ll examine where the quality of \u2018aliveness\u2019 comes from. We\u2019ll look at ways we can seek it out and how to nurture it. We\u2019ll examine the special role that *negotiation* plays in delivering longer-lasting design ideas, and we\u2019ll finish up with a set of practical negotiation techniques that you\u2019ll be able to apply within your own digital projects.</p> <p>// About Andrew<br/>Andrew Grimes (<a href=\"http://apgrimes.co.uk/\" class=\"linkified\">http://apgrimes.co.uk/</a>) is a Principal Experience Designer at Nationwide, Bristol (<a href=\"http://www.nationwide.co.uk/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.nationwide.co.uk/</a>).
