On August 4, we will be talking to Alon Gubkin, VP R&amp;D of Aporia, about Building an ML Platform from Scratch: Live Coding Session - Part 2!</p> <p>// Register at:<br/><a href=\"https://go.mlops.community/register\" class=\"linkified\">https://go.mlops.community/register</a></p> <p>// Abstract:<br/>In our previous live coding session, we built an ML platform using MLFlow, DVC, Pulumi, and other tools.</p> <p>As requested by the community, during the second session we'll focus on how to add solutions for Model Monitoring and Training Orchestration.</p> <p>All codes will be available on GitHub after the workshop!</p> <p>// Bio:<br/>Alon Gubkin is the VP R&amp;D at Aporia. Writing code from the age of 7, Alon has an unhealthy obsession with programming and a huge love for mixing engineering with data science. When he isn't coding, Alon enjoys playing video games and musing about biology.</p> <p>// Final thoughts<br/>Please feel free to drop some questions you may have beforehand into our slack channel (<a href=\"https://go.mlops.community/slack\" class=\"linkified\">https://go.mlops.community/slack</a>)<br/>Watch some old meetups on our youtube channel:<br/><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG6qpjVnBTTT8wLGBygANOQ\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG6qpjVnBTTT8wLGBygANOQ</a></p> ",
