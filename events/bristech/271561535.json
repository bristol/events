Unfortunately, the majority of operational ML projects never make it to production. The most significant blocker is the lack of infrastructure and tooling required to build production-ready data for ML.</p> <p>Kevin Stumpf has a long history of building data infrastructure for ML, first for Uber Michelangelo, and most recently as co-founder of Tecton. Kevin will share his insights on the challenges of getting ML features to production. We\u2019ll discuss the role of the feature store in bringing DevOps-like efficiency to building ML features. Kevin will also provide an overview of Tecton, which aims to bring an enterprise-grade feature store to every company.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Kevin co-founded Tecton where he leads a world-class engineering team that is building a next-generation data platform for operational Machine Learning. Kevin and his co-founders built deep expertise in operational ML platforms while at Uber, where they created the Michelangelo platform that enabled Uber to scale from 0 to 1000's of ML-driven applications in just a few years. Prior to Uber, Kevin founded Dispatcher, with the vision to build the Uber for long-haul trucking. Kevin holds an MBA from Stanford University and a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from the University of Hagen. Outside of work, Kevin is a passionate long-distance endurance athlete.<br/>Please feel free to drop some questions you may have beforehand into our slack channel (<a href=\"https://bit.ly/33wDUf1\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/33wDUf1</a>)</p> ",
