From the smartphones in our pockets to the devices at the heart of our digital homes, we\u2019re never far from speech recognition technology. Not only does it enable new ways of interacting with computers, it\u2019s also set to reshape Human Computer Interaction for people requiring assistive technologies.</p> <p>The humble web browser is no exception. The speechRecognitionAPI enables developers to incorporate advanced speech interactions into today\u2019s web applications. But is it any good? Combining two of his passions, Tony sets out to discover if the speechRecognitionAPI can be used as an aid in transcribing hip-hop lyrics during the writing process.</p> <p>After an introduction to the broader technology, a mix of audio, video and live performance tells the tale of creating an MVP transcription application to aid in the writing of new songs. As a development project, each iteration of the app is accompanied by a set of unit tests. The final unit test is executed live, resulting in a crescendo you won\u2019t want to miss.</p> <p>// About Tony</p> <p>Tony Edwards is one half of Future Sync Events, a tech focused event company based in the South West. Tony is also part of the team at Software Cornwall, a network of digital businesses in the county, where he has helped inspire the next generation of budding developers to follow their digital dreams and enter the broader software industry.</p> <p>In recent years, Tony has been supporting the regions digital communities through volunteering, speaking and helping to organise events. Whether it\u2019s live blogging for award winning Agile conferences, managing social media for community meetups, producing swag for awards ceremonies or simply attending, if there\u2019s something happening for the digitally minded in the far South West\u2026. chances are Tony is in the mix somehow.</p> <p>Social Profiles<br/>Website: <a href=\"https://www.tonyedwardspz.co.uk\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.tonyedwardspz.co.uk</a><br/>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tonyedwardspz\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/tonyedwardspz</a><br/>Instagram: <a href=\"https://instagram.com/tonyedwardspz\" class=\"linkified\">https://instagram.com/tonyedwardspz</a><br/>LinkedIn: <a href=\"http://linkedin.com/in/tonyedwardspz\" class=\"linkified\">http://linkedin.com/in/tonyedwardspz</a><br/>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/tonyedwardspz\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/tonyedwardspz</a><br/>Medium: <a href=\"https://medium.com/@tonyedwardspz\" class=\"linkified\">https://medium.com/@tonyedwardspz</a></p> <p>// Andrew Chaa - Domain Driven Design: From Event Storming to Real Working APIs</p> <p>We will start from event storming. We will define what events we have and what behaviours they are going to trigger. Then we will build an API app with ASP.NET Core. We will use Mediatr and Mediator pattern to define our domain events and event handlers. The stormed-out business process will guide and drive our code. With this session, I'd like to share the practical journey from event storming to an actual working microservice. This wouldn't be about in-depth event storming or API design. It will be more of raw, down-to-earth, no-bullshit, no unicorn but super-real showcase of Domain Driven Design in action.</p> <p>The session will consists of</p> <p>\u2022Event Storming with sticky notes<br/>\u2022Building APIs with Mediatr<br/>\u2022Introduce Domain Objects and DTOs<br/>\u2022Unit testing through public interfaces</p> <p>// About Andrew<br/>Andrew Young H Chaa is an experienced API and Cloud platform Developer with a demonstrated history of working on large scale, high capacity distributed systems. Skilled in message and event driven Microservice Architecture, CQRS, and Functional-flavoured Programming. Having worked at Just Eat and currently working at Clear Bank as Principal Engineer.</p> ",
