It uses tests written in javascript and has many similar concepts to rspec. Where it excels is in ease of debugging through its \u2018Time Travel\u2019 feature; its live interaction with the application under test and its handling of timeouts and promises. It\u2019s also much easier to set up than Selenium, Poltergeist and so on. This talk will provide an introduction to Cypress and show how it can be used to test a Rails application.\"</p> <p>Richard Brooke is a software engineer with over 30 years experience. His early career involved loading half-inch tape reels onto backup drives and his latter career has involved much the same, but with Ruby and some other programming languages thrown in. Luckily the tar command still works.</p> <p>20:00 - 21:00 - More mingling</p> <p>**Slack**</p> <p>If you'd like to join us on Slack please join <a href=\"https://bathruby-for-slackers.herokuapp.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://bathruby-for-slackers.herokuapp.com</a> and find us in the #south-west-ruby channel</p> ",
