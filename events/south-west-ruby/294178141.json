I'll show how we filter out spam in HEY and how this same system can be used by your Rails app.\"</p> <p>Lewis is a programmer at 37signals, in the Security, Infrastructure and Performance (SIP) team, working on Basecamp and HEY. He's a co-organizer of South West Ruby, and is now working remotely from south Devon.</p> <p>19:30 **\\- \"Data Indexing with RGB \\(Ruby\\, Graphs and Bitmaps\\)\" \\- Benji Lewis**</p> <p>In this talk, we will go on a journey through Zappi\u2019s data history and how we are using Ruby, a graph database, and a bitmap store to build a unique data engine. A journey that starts with the problem of a disconnected data set and serialised data frames, and ends with the solution of an in-memory index.</p> <p>We will explore how we used RedisGraph to model the relationships in our data, connecting semantically equal nodes. Then delve into how a query layer was used to index a bitmap store and, in turn, led to us being able to interrogate our entire dataset orders of magnitude faster than before.</p> <p>20:00 - 21:00 - More mingling</p> <p>**Slack**</p> <p>If you'd like to join us on Slack please join [Bristol &amp; Bath Ruby Slack](<a href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/bath-and-bristol-ruby/shared_invite/zt-1gnf6q40k-GfPoQThrqCj8AHq0wA4_qg\" class=\"linkified\">https://join.slack.com/t/bath-and-bristol-ruby/shared_invite/zt-1gnf6q40k-GfPoQThrqCj8AHq0wA4_qg</a>) and find us in the #south-west-ruby channel</p> ",
