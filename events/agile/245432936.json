    "description": "<p><b>Making Stone Soup (story-telling for collaboration &amp; team building)</b><br/>Productivity is about doing the right work as effectively as possible. The sooner you and your colleagues can all get on to the same page, the sooner you can start work together. The more aligned you are with each other's point of view and your shared objective, the faster you will be able to move towards it.</p> <p>So, is there really a way we can improve these aspects of our working interactions to have a material effect on our productivity? I think so. I think we should look to the roots of humanity.</p> <p>Human beings are hard-wired to appreciate stories. Not just about how our weekend was, but actually woven into the very fabric of what makes us human. These skills are the foundations of influence, of coaching, and of collaborating.</p> <p>Using a familiar childhood story I will illustrate how the same story can be used to teach multiple things, such as how collaboration and facilitation works. We will explore why some stories are better than others.</p> <p>I will also cover how we can use stories to build our teams and our tribes, and how we can use them to talk about ourselves.</p> <p>About Helen<br/><b>Helen Lisowski</b> trains and mentors talented people in the Software Development Industry to build great habits.
