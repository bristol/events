    "description": "<p>Join us for pizza and a thought provoking session with Lucy Power, hosted by IOP Publishing in central Bristol. The session is a guide to a coaching theory around relationships, and no prior knowledge is required. The theory is relevant regardless of your role and agile inclinations, especially if you interact with actual people.</p> <p>In this workshop you will learn what Transactional Analysis is and some small but effective key pieces of the theory. Mainly you will learn how to impact your life with this learning, taking your new understanding out into your work, life and relationships and improving them immediately!<br/>We will cover the key principles of the approach, ego states and games, life script and how to become free of all of this limiting, constraining and troublesome stuff which keeps us from showing up as we actually want to in our worlds.</p> <p>Takeaways: The impact will be that you\u2019ll know how to get back in control of yourself when you are stressed, over emotional, overly shut down or dancing around like a headless chicken. You\u2019ll have the understanding of what happens for you and others, and more importantly what happens BETWEEN you and others and how to impact this toward improvement and greater satisfaction.</p> <p>IOP Publishing are our kind hosts this evening. They provide a range of journals, ebooks, magazines, websites and services that enable researchers and research organisations to reach the widest possible audience for their research.
