This creates a continuity of purpose, aligns stakeholders, and facilitates prioritisation. While roadmaps are a very useful tool, applying them in Scrum\u00a0poses a number of challenges:</p> <p>How can we create a realistic roadmap when markets and technologies change frequently and unexpectedly? How can we build a longer-term plan when agile teams commit to no more than four weeks? How do the product roadmap and the product backlog relate? Do they compete with or complement each other?</p> <p>This talk shares Roman's insights on leveraging agile roadmaps successfully. It answers the questions above and introduces a goal-oriented, agile product roadmap, which combines shared goals and key features into a strategic plan, and provides an umbrella for the product backlog.</p> <p><b>Who is Roman Pichler?</b></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/5/e/6/600_129270182.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Roman is a leading agile and lean product management expert, a Certified Scrum Trainer, and the founder of Pichler Consulting.
