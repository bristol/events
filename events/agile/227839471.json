Consciously or not, most people adopt Scrum by blindly following a so-called Scrum expert; that\u2019s not so good.\u00a0</p> <p>As more organisations look to an Agile transition to become more efficient, I\u2019m keen to make sure that they realise that there is more to Agile than just Scrum.\u00a0</p> <p><b>About James:</b> A seasoned Agile veteran, James Harvey has been an Agile practitioner, coach and crusader for over a decade.\u00a0</p> <p>Recognised as an accredited training partner with the BCS, James is also certified Agile trainer focusing on the framework-agnostic BCS Agile syllabus.</p> ",
