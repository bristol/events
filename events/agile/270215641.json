We\u2019d like to offer the opportunity to get together and share the knowledge across the community. It's also just a really nice chance to connect with some friendly familiar faces!</p> <p>In this workshop we\u2019ll be opening up to find out how you are doing, and then breaking out into some rooms for some specialised topic discussions. We\u2019ll then summarise our findings back into the group so that we are pooling the outcome of these discussions.</p> <p>We\u2019ll be hosting discussion rooms on:</p> <p>- Keeping focus. How to motivate and pace yourself and your teams when working through global crisis</p> <p>- Facilitating collaborative discussion. How to make the stifled online experience more engaging and better set out for group problem solving.</p> <p>- Not in work? What are you doing if you are either furloughed or not in employment? Discussion on how to keep skills up to date or work to transfer offering online.</p> <p>- Agile Games over the internet. Sharing ideas about what you\u2019ve tried, what has worked, and what people should avoid!</p> ",
