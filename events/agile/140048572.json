    "description": "<p>Hi</p> <p>I've recently joined JLT in Bristol and in an effort to reignite the agile transformation of the development teams we have recruited Emma Hopkinson-Spark as an agile coach/scrum master.</p> <p>In her first few weeks Emma has identified a lack of Product Ownership as the most significant challenge facing our development organisation. We're trying to build a large business application for multiple remote business owners often with conflicting priorities. We're nowhere near a solution but as it's a problem I've faced in previous roles I wondered whether it would be a possible topic for the October meet-up?</p> <p>I've talked very briefly to Emma about this and she would be willing to put a presentation together on our situation and how we're looking to address these problems.</p> <p>Let me know if this is of interest and we can try to put more material together.</p> <p>Regards<br/>Alex</p> ",
