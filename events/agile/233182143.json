    "description": "<p>The Bath Scrum User Group hits 50 this month - that's 50 meetings since May 2012, so let's celebrate with a social gathering at The Cork where we held the first meeting.</p> <p>Since then we have often ventured outside Bath, and often covered topics beyond core Scrum. By we have built a strong community, do come along to catch up and network with other members of the group. The format is flexible: we may run a Lean Coffee session, and bear in mind that both drinks and food will be available at The Cork.</p> <p>Hope to see you all there!</p> ",
