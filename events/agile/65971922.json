    "description": "<p>Large-scale software and systems development involves a complex mix of people, teams, technologies, skills, architectures, and organisational structures that must all interact for projects to reach their goals. However, many organisations struggle to scale up agile approaches for their various programs, products, and services. Karl Scotland introduces a process model for designing a contextually appropriate Kanban system for complex and large-scale development. Karl will show you how to design a custom Kanban system by studying the current development process, reaching an initial system understanding, sharing that understanding, putting limits in place, sensing how the system is performing, and continually learning from the system to guide improvements.</p> <p><b>Who is Karl Scotland?</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/f/8/event_125101272.jpegKarl\" class=\"linkified\">http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/f/8/event_125101272.jpegKarl</a> is a versatile software practitioner with over 15 years of experience covering development, project management, team leadership, coaching and training.
