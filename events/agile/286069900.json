You'll probably be the first group to experience this so there'll be a bit of trial and error and a forgiving approach to the session.</p> <p>Expect high levels of audience participation, collaboration and the odd joke or two.</p> <p>Please note: This will be an in-person event in central Bristol with no remote facilities</p> <p>About the speaker:<br/>Realising he's been doing Product Development with Agile teams for nearly 20 years, Andy has been there, done that and worn the t-shirt several times over. Still learning new things and working with teams of awesome people, Andy is the author of Applying Scrum With Kanban, a book that is definitely not pointless!</p> ",
