    "description": "<p>**Update 15th Feb: Despite what meetup is telling you, this is still a hybrid in person and remote event.**</p> <p>Solution Focus Coaching is a simple, effective approach to individual, group and team coaching. Despite its name it has little to do with jumping to solutions and solutionising. More of a way of thinking than a process, the emphasis of Solution Focus is deciding what to go towards and the discovery of new, sometimes unexpected, ways to get there.</p> <p>The approach is distinguished from other methods by it\u2019s experimental, forward looking nature, a recognition that every individual, team and organisation is different and resourceful enough to find better ways to do and think. It works as well for getting unstuck in spontaneous coaching moments as it does meticulously planned workshops.</p> <p>In this session we\u2019ll take a look at the tenets of Solution Focus, hear how it works in harmony with agile approaches and get some practical try-it-tomorrow fieldwork. Theory will be mixed with hard earned practical experience working in agile and transformation teams across organisational levels and domains.</p> <p>About John<br/>John Clapham is a leadership coach and agile consultant, specialising in developing organisational agility. He helps leaders to think clearly and organisations learn to become more effective, productive and enjoyable to work in. Recognising that people, teams and organisations are all unique, John is not wedded to any particular agile approach, preferring to focus on foundational behaviours alongside uncovering and amplifying what\u2019s already working. John's forays into coaching, lean and agile are fuelled by coffee and Bristol's frequently inclement weather. <a href=\"https://www.cotelic.co.uk/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.cotelic.co.uk/</a></p> <p>About our hosts<br/>Ovo Energy and Kaluza are building a supportive zero carbon community \u2013 and bringing everyone the green energy, technology and guidance they need to make change happen.
