I bring these skills to bear in my work in the Agile field, where I have been engaged as a freelance consultant since 2005.</p> <p>I educate and guide from a principles perspective, rather than a process-focused one. This approach allows organisations to contextualize the Agile principles, and wisely apply the practices of Scrum, Kanban and XP in a way that can be embraced by the whole organisation.</p> <p>You can follow Tobias on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/tobiasmayer\">Twitter</a> here.</p> ",
