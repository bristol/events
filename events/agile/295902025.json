    "description": "<p>Once upon a time, in a galaxy close to the M32, a group formed with a mission to serve up education, community and fun to the Agile community in Bristol and Bath.</p> <p>Agile Bath and Bristol Meet Up Group are coming back! With some exciting new workshops and a host of new organisers to help us live up to our mission!</p> <p>To kick-off we are hosting the agile game designer &amp; story weaver, Carl Rogers, to lead us in an Agile Game of epic proportions!</p> <p>The Agile Animalia Game (or Zoo Game) is a truly fun way to explore an emergent, collaborative approach to agile at scale. Together we will run a simulated Agile Transformation for an organisation, in a fun, game based format.</p> <p>There's lots to learn, and you can experience the game for yourself, gather some tools to help your organisation find it's 'right fit agility', as well get access to download the game it so that you can run it yourself in your own organisation!</p> <p>We look forward to welcoming you with pizza, beer/cider and friendly hello, whether you are a returning member, interested agilist, or curious member of the community - it's a great chance to meet others in Agile and learn together!</p> <p>**Sponsor &amp; Location**<br/>Proudly sponsored by JustEat, who will be hosting in their fantastic central Bristol venue, while reminding us who's the boss when it comes to takeaway&amp; delivery goodness!</p> ",
