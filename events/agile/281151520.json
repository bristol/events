They knew they wanted to achieve their targets within 3 years, and they also knew they wanted to start small and experimental, but didn\u2019t have any way to connect the two things. Over a course of iterations, I\u2019ve landed on the Outcomes Tree metaphor to help people make the connections. It\u2019s responsive and adaptive in its approach and works in software and non-software environments \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s well suited for individuals, teams and enterprises to meet their goals.</p> <p>&gt; It's been described as \u201cThe new North Star\u201d and \u201cquite simply brilliant\u201d.</p> <p>This \u2018Green Shoots\u2019 workshop is an introduction to the idea of The Outcomes Tree. By attending, you\u2019ll have a chance to sign up to my \u2018Growth Academy\u2019 so that we can work side-by-side on your very own outcomes tree over a number of weeks.</p> <p><a href=\"https://mrgrayston.com/the-outcomes-tree/\" class=\"linkified\">https://mrgrayston.com/the-outcomes-tree/</a></p> ",
