    "description": "<p>Once upon a time XP was new and exciting. Scrum has long since become the mainstream approach to Agile. Nowadays it seems that Agile is more about project management than software development. Teams at Unruly still use XP and we\u2019ve continued to evolve our practice. Modern XP is not Scrum with a smattering of TDD. XP values and principles pervade our whole approach to product development. Come to this talk to hear how teams at Unruly deliver continuous value with XP.</p> <p><i>About our speaker:</i></p> <p><b>Rachel Davies</b> coaches product development teams at <a href=\"http://tech.unruly.co\">Unruly</a>\u00a0in London.
