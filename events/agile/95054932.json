As the first Certified Scrum Coach and the longest serving Certified Scrum Trainer, he is highly experienced in the application of Scrum as well as being qualified as a personal and business coach. Even his training courses are based as much around bringing out the knowledge already within the room as it is about being a teacher. His philosophy is based on belief in human potential and creating and supporting a sense of self-awareness and self-confidence in his clients, both individual and organisational.</p> <p>In this session Geoff will invite the audience to set the agenda and open the stage for people to explore the topics that are of most interest to them and will then attempt to facilitate some form of resolution, even if it's something to which he has no answer himself.</p> <p>You can follow Geoff on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/geoffcwatts\">Twitter</a></p> <p>\u00a0</p> ",
