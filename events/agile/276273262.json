    "description": "<p>Agile coaching isn't about being proficient in agile methodologies, frameworks or even practices and \"helping\" others to adopt them. So who, or what, is an \"agile\" coach? Could an agile coach actually coach individuals, teams or organisations further away from agile and still be doing their job? Leadership coach and agile author Geoff Watts will explore the overlap and differences between the world of professional and agile coaching, sharing his view on this widely interpreted role of the agile coach.</p> <p>Our speaker:<br/>Geoff helps leadership teams create an empowering culture throughout their organisation; one that is resilient to the rapid changes we face in the business world today and harnesses the power of self-organising agile teams.</p> <p>You can learn more about his services here: <a href=\"https://www.inspectandadapt.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.inspectandadapt.com/</a></p> ",
