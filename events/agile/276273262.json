    "description": "<p>Agile coaching isn't about being proficient in agile methodologies, frameworks or even practices and \"helping\" others to adopt them. So who, or what, is an \"agile\" coach? Could an agile coach actually coach individuals, teams or organisations further away from agile and still be doing their job? Leadership coach and agile author Geoff Watts will explore the overlap and differences between the world of professional and agile coaching, sharing his view on this widely interpreted role of the agile coach.</p> <p>To allow more general chatting time the evening will be split into two sections, you can join for the whole or just part, just RSVP as usual.<br/>Part 1 ( 6:00 - 6:45 ) Talk, Q&amp;A<br/>Part 2 ( 7.00 - 7:30 ) Open Spaces - For networking, socialising, lightning talks etc</p> <p>The talk will take the usual format, with time for discussion after. Around 7.00pm we\u2019ll make a number of rooms available for the open space, and you\u2019ll be able to go where you please. Rooms may host pre-selected content, if for example someone would like to host a lightning talk, or lean coffee. As always we\u2019ll be guided by the community and improvise on the night.</p> <p>Our speakers:</p> <p>Geoff Watts<br/>Geoff helps leadership teams create an empowering culture throughout their organisation; one that is resilient to the rapid changes we face in the business world today and harnesses the power of self-organising agile teams.</p> <p>You can learn more about his services here: <a href=\"https://www.inspectandadapt.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.inspectandadapt.com/</a></p> <p>Aislinn Green<br/>Aislinn has worked in an agile coaching capacity since 2005.
