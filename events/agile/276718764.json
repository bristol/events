Visualisation, whether through SketchNoting, Graphic Recording, or Visual Facilitation is having a moment in Agile circles.</p> <p>And yet no-where in the manifesto does it mention Neuland Markers...</p> <p>So why are all these types of doodling becoming so popular in Agile circles, and what can you learn from the techniques even if you have no interest in art, drawing or graphic design?</p> <p>Gemma Honour, Agile Coach and Doodle Witch, will lead you in a workshop to try out some techniques to help you in your Agile practice that will require NO ARTISTIC SKILL whatsoever!</p> <p>Please bring some paper and pens of your choice, and we'll see you ready to doodle!</p> <p>As per our new format, the talk/workshop will last around 45 minutes - then we'll create some break out spaces for people to mill about and compare notes/socialise afterwards.</p> ",
