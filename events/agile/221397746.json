    "description": "<p>In the modern software development organization we talk about projects, process, teams, and features but we hardly ever talk deeply about their effect on the substrate - the architecture and code that make or break us over time.</p> <p>In this talk, Michael Feathers will play devil\u2019s advocate and flip this state of affairs upside-down. He\u2019ll talk about the radical idea of placing code and architecture first, making team structure, process, staffing, and even feature choice subservient to it.\u00a0</p> <p>If this sounds like heresy to you - rest assured, it is. But it is a perspective that the helps us understand the range of options open to us in software development.</p> <p><i>About our speaker:</i></p> <p><b>Michael Feathers</b> is the Founder and Director of R7K Research &amp; Conveyance, a company specializing in software and organization design.
