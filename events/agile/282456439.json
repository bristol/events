    "description": "<p>2021 is nearly done, and while we firmly believe in the power of positive thinking there might just be a few little things you\u2019d like to get off your chest, ready for a clean start in January...</p> <p>...and so the ABB team and aspiring punologists bring you...A Christmas Ranto. Share your short stories, your epic wins and terrible defeats, heroes and villains, poisonous apples and awakening kisses.</p> <p>If all that sounds a bit too theatrical, what we\u2019re really looking for is light hearted lightning talks around 5 to 10 minutes. To be honest, they don't even have to be that ranty. It\u2019s a great opportunity to take to the stage for the first time. More seasoned performers may like to try the dreaded PechaKucha.</p> <p>Talks should meet the following criteria:<br/>-Something you\u2019re passionate about<br/>-Something the group will enjoy and might learn from<br/>-Kind and inclusive - You\u2019re welcome to share how you overcame a frustrating tool or process, just don\u2019t rant about a person, company, discriminate or over generalise about a group.</p> <p>If we can figure out how, we\u2019ll vote so you can see how relatable your rant is.</p> <p>After the talk we\u2019ll raise a glass (or mince pie) in honour of the players and enjoy a natter. Duration will depend on the number of talks, and subsequent sociability.</p> <p>So, Let us know if you\u2019ve got a talk, or a gem of an idea, we look forward to hearing from you.</p> <p>By the way, Gemma, Stuart, Ewan and John were hoping this would be an in-person event, and we certainly hope to resume those in the new year. For now though, we\u2019ll play it safe, and hope to see you somewhere soon.</p> <p>Update: We've had a slow response to this one, which is fine, experimentation is a key part of agility :-) We're going to cancel this, wish you a merry Christmas, and hope to see you next year!</p> ",
