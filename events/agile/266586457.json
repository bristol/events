    "description": "<p>Join us for a highly interactive workshop on Mob Drawing! A way of embracing diversity of thought and convergent thinking through visualisation techniques, run by Stuart Young.</p> <p>How can you create an environment where all members of a team feel safe to be creative? The best ideas come from embracing group diversity, not silo thinking.</p> <p>Stuart will demonstrate how everyone has the ability to visualise their ideas and how you can welcome the judgement, preferences, and beliefs of all individuals within a working group.</p> <p>Expect high levels of audience participation, collaboration and pen action. No ability to draw is required for you to get the most out of this workshop!</p> <p>About the speaker:</p> <p>Stuart Young (Innovation Practice Lead at Radtac) describes himself as a Business Visualiser, Agile Enthusiast, Design-Thinker and Empathy driven storyteller.</p> <p>When Stuart is not assisting businesses to simplify complexity through live illustration he is facilitating a suite of Design Thinking and Visual Thinking Skills workshops that catalyse customer centric creativity and innovation.</p> <p>You can find out more about the services Stuart offers by viewing Radtac\u2019s Visualisation services and Innovation practice.
