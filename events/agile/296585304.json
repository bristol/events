    "description": "<p>Once upon a time, in a galaxy close to the M32, a group formed with a mission to serve up education, community and fun to the Agile community in Bristol and Bath.</p> <p>Agile Bath and Bristol Meet Up Group are coming back! With some exciting new workshops and a host of new organisers to help us live up to our mission!</p> <p>To celebrate the festive holiday season, we are holding a quiz night. Do not expect just your average questions about sports or music, oh no. This is not your average quiz! As we are an Agile meetup there will also be rounds of questions surrounding our joint passion.</p> <p>We look forward to welcoming you with pizza, beer/cider and friendly hello, whether you are a returning member, interested agilist, or curious member of the community - it's a great chance to meet others in Agile and learn together!</p> <p>This event is hosted by Optilearn who believe that training isn\u2019t just about gaining knowledge which is why all of their workshops and classes are specifically designed to give you actionable techniques that you can benefit from tomorrow. Check them out at <a href=\"https://optilearn.co.uk\" class=\"linkified\">https://optilearn.co.uk</a></p> ",
