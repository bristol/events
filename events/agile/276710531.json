Sick of having the same conversations over and over again\u2026\u2026..ever thought about why this happens?</p> <p>If the above sounds familiar to you, then this is a psychological game, the concept comes from Eric Berne, the founder of Transactional Analysis (TA)</p> <p>What is a game? In non-TA language it is a situation which gets repeated and all the players have a negative feeling at the end. If you are familiar with the Drama Triangle then this is also how games can be played with persecutors, rescuers and victims.</p> <p>This session will focus on the games being played in Scrum! What they are, who they are played with and what\u2019s behind them? We will explore how to break out of them and reduce their impact.<br/>This will be an experiential session with breakouts/small group discussion.</p> <p>Nims Dhawan \u2013 is a Trainee Transactional Analyst (Organisational), OD consultant and executive coach.
