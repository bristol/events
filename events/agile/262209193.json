Both our speakers are from OVO: Agile Coach Georgie Hopkinson will uncover The Power of Empathy while Product Manager Christina Daly will talk about How to get the best from teams.</p> <p>Georgie's talk was recently presented at the SouthWest Leaders In Tech MeetUp</p> <p>Georgie Hopkinson - The Power of Empathy</p> <p>My talk is about the power that something so deceptively simple can have if you know how to do it properly. I will talk you through the massive impact that putting empathy first can have and then my top tips on how you can learn to bring it to the forefront of your mind, with an opportunity to practice.</p> <p>Christina Daly - How to get the best from teams</p> <p>Teams are like tribes all of their own. Each one has a unique set of strengths and dysfunctions that shape the way they work. In this talk I'll introduce the dysfunctions of teams, what psychological safety really means, what behaviours undermine it, and the role each of us as team members play in improving it.</p> ",
