Test could wait while we did the important work of specifying, designing\u00a0and coding the system. Test was what we did to find bugs. Test was reactive.</p> <p>That was then. Test should not be that unpleasant activity at the end of the development phase; it is an integral and critical part of everyday work.\u00a0\u00a0It does not\u00a0add drudgery, or overhead; it adds rewarding feedback and makes it possible to put more value into the software instead of wasting time chasing bugs. Test is specification; test is defect prevention, test drives good designs. Tests must be largely automated, though you may\u00a0think that you cannot afford to automate; when in reality, you cannot afford not to.</p> <p>--</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/6/9/4/event_209434452.jpeg\" /></p> <p>James Grenning trains, coaches, and consults worldwide.
