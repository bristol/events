    "description": "<p>Once upon a time, in a galaxy close to the M32, a group formed with a mission to serve up education, community and fun to the Agile community in Bristol and Bath.</p> <p>Agile Bath and Bristol Meet Up Group are back! With some exciting new workshops and a host of new organisers to help us live up to our mission!</p> <p>For our second meetup back, we are hosting Becky who will take us into the world of continuous learning.</p> <p>Agility means continuous learning. But this doesn't have to remain within the bounds of product development. The world around us is changing at an ever increasing rate and us squishy knowledge workers have more and more to learn in order to keep up!</p> <p>This workshop will give you ideas and inspiration for doing continuous learning with a cohort of like-minded people using agile principles and frameworks.</p> <p>We look forward to welcoming you with pizza, beer/cider and friendly hello, whether you are a returning member, interested agilist, or curious member of the community - it's a great chance to meet others in Agile and learn together!</p> <p>**Sponsor &amp; Location**<br/>Located in a fantastic central Bristol venue, while reminding us who's the boss when it comes to takeaway&amp; delivery goodness! Food and drink sponsored by Optilearn.</p> ",
