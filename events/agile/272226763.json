    "description": "<p>A Drama in the Office: how a little bit of performing arts can help our teams\u2019 performance.</p> <p>I would like to share the lessons I\u2019ve learned from the world of theatre that relate to our experiences in the workplace. Part talk, part interactive workshop, I\u2019ll share how we can learn from the experiences in the theatre world and apply them to the business world. We\u2019ll focus, in particular, on how we create safe, trusting environments to encourage play -otherwise known as \u2018rehearsal rooms\u2019. No cringey drama games. Promise.</p> <p>About Sam Grayston:</p> <p>Alongside working in some of the largest membership organisations in the UK, Sam has spent most of his life involved in the theatre in both a professional and non-profit capacity. Acting, directing, writing, producing, and teaching has been fun in its own right, but has also provided the empathy to help people succeed; the creativity to solve problems; and the communication skills to translate the complex to the accessible.</p> <p>In corporate land, Sam has worked in communications, events, strategy, engagement, governance, and community support - and is currently an Agility Coach at Nationwide Building Society, helping liberate great things from people and teams across the business.</p> ",
