    "description": "<p><b>What is Behavior Driven Development?</b></p> <p>BDD is a technique for helping team members collaborate and discover\u00a0requirements in their project. It uses examples to illustrate the\u00a0intended behavior of systems before they're implemented, so that the\u00a0team can discover more examples and develop a shared understanding of\u00a0the requirements. In this talk Liz will show why conversations are the\u00a0most important aspect of BDD, how examples can help you discover\u00a0things early, and why discovery is an inevitable part of software\u00a0development.</p> <p><b>Who is Liz Keogh?</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/8/2/8/event_123798472.jpegLiz\" class=\"linkified\">http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/8/2/8/event_123798472.jpegLiz</a> is an experienced Lean and Agile coach, trainer, blogger and\u00a0well-known international speaker.
