    "description": "<p>We're very pleased to announce that our next meet-up is going to be hosted by Cookpad at their Bristol offices - <a href=\"https://www.cookpadteam.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.cookpadteam.com/</a></p> <p>Cookpad is a technology company with a mission to make everyday cooking fun. Their Bristol office is home to the global headquarters.</p> <p>Schedule:</p> <p>18:00 - Doors/Food/Drinks/Networking<br/>18:30 - Opening Introduction/Community Messages<br/>18:40 - Dan Cook - \"Explainable Word Embeddings\"<br/>19.15 - Avon Huxor - TBD<br/>20:00 - Wrap up and head to a nearby pub</p> <p>Talks:</p> <p>Dan Cook - \"Explainable Word Embeddings\"<br/>After talking about what word embeddings are and why they\u2019re important, particularly with regard to text classification tasks, we\u2019ll cover a history of what text enrichment before neural nets looked like and then a general overview of how word2vec works.</p> <p>My research has focussed on combining the old with the new. How can you form a low dimensional representation to represent a word, that locates synonymous words close together, but attaches human readable labels to each dimension of the vector (unlike a neural net generated word embedding!).</p> <p>I\u2019ll then discuss how the concept can be applied to recommendation engines, think shopping cart, to explain why certain items have been shown to us.</p> <p>Bio:</p> <p>Dan is working in the MLOps space for Rovco, deploying machine learning at scale on Kubernetes. His background includes the technical leadership of large Hadoop deployments, building a single view of a customer through knowledge graphs and degrees in both Computer Science and Data Science.</p> <p>-----<br/>Avon Huxor - TBD</p> <p>Bio:</p> <p>After some twenty years working as a research astronomer, I moved into data science and machine learning. I currently work on analysis of texts from medical documents at the University of Bristol.</p> <p>-----</p> <p>Please note the talks will be filmed.</p> <p>The Bristol ML meet-up is defined by its community. If you have ideas for speakers, venues or suggestions for how we can in anyway improve please don't hesitate to contact one of the organisers.</p> <p>This is a going to be a really great set of talks, hope to see you there!</p> <p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors, organizers and volunteers at this meetup are required to agree with the following code of conduct.
