Small Bar!</p> <p>--</p> <p>Seasons greetings</p> <p>In 2016 has been an amazing year for Bristol JS.</p> <p>- We've grown by 444 members to 1167.<br/>- We've had 21 fantastic talks over 11 talk nights.<br/>- We've gained some new friends Novate IT, Pusher &amp; Potato Bristol who have supported us through this growth.</p> <p>The group's purpose is to educate and provide the value of community to each of its members. The social aspect is massively important to continuing this (and I can personally say I've made some of my closest friends through the group).</p> <p>This month we're breaking our normal procedure and having a social night in place of a talk night and we'd be delighted if you could join us.</p> <p>Tonight we're meeting at Small Bar from 18:30. They do some fantastic burgers if you want to join us for some food.<br/>Please RSVP so I can get an idea of numbers.</p> <p>Lastly, if you can't make it have a fantastic Christmas and we look forward to seeing you in 2017.</p> <p>Adam Butler<br/>@labfoo</p> ",
