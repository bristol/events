Comparing offline storage mechanisms, and their limitations.</p> <p>This talk is great for anyone building web-based applications, in any language, or anyone wanting to learn more about PWA's and offline development</p> <p>----------------------------------</p> <p>Huge thank you to our sponsors Novate IT, SR2, Travel Local &amp; Immersive labs.</p> <p>Also our amazing hosts Zone Digital who will be supplying our space, food and drinks!</p> <p>Video Recording Sponsored by Pusher</p> <p>You can view previous event talks and more by visiting the Pusher App YouTube channel!</p> <p>Pusher is a hosted service with APIs, developer tools and open source libraries that greatly simplify integrating real-time functionality into web and mobile applications.</p> <p>Pusher will automatically scale when required, removing all the pain of setting up and maintaining a secure, real-time infrastructure.</p> <p>Pusher is already trusted to do so by thousands of developers and companies like GitHub, MailChimp, the Financial Times, Buffer and many more.</p> <p>Getting started takes just a few seconds: simply go to pusher.com and create a free account.
