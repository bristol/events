We have probably all experienced moments when a conversation or a meeting room full of people suddenly goes quiet. This can be a precious moment - sharing silence creates more space and connects us. But most of the times we soon start to feel uncomfortable. The stillness seems to get louder \u2013 silence is ringing in our ears. A strong urge arises to fill the void with words.</p> <p>Being comfortable with silence in any meeting, interview or client brief is an expert collaborative behaviour. It helps developing and deepening our listening skills which will lead to a more effective way of communication.
