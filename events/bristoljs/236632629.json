The principles around Flow and type checking in general are fairly simple, but I'll run through how and why you should try out type checking and Flow specifically but then dive into some of the other benefits and side effects you get from using it.\": string);</p> <p><b>Martin Kearn - Machine Learning for Muggles</b></p> <p>Artificial Intelligence is the latest hotness. Machine Learning sits behind artificial intelligence and on the surface it may seem like a deeply technical, scientific topic. We are here to tell you that it is more accessible than you think. We\u2019ll look at some of the basics around the Azure Machine Learning service.
