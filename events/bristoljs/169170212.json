    "description": "<p>Our inaugural meetup was talking about Meteor. To be fair I put on a pretty poor show. Yet you guys have stuck around.</p> <p>Maybe you thought it was funny watching me talk about something I clearly knew nothing about. Perhaps it was watching me trying to live deploy a chat app with my usual trick of booking a venue without wifi. Or was it I booked a room without chairs?</p> <p>For a long time I promised to revisit it. Each time I made that promise, it was a lie and I knew it. I had no intention of ever speaking in public again.</p> <p>To celebrate our 2 year anniversary we are going to revisit Meteor. Version 1 is \"just around the corner\" so perhaps now is the time to see if Meteor has legs or if Angular + socket + someotherjs does better.</p> <p>Time TBC.</p> ",
