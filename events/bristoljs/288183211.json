    "description": "<p>**Adam Butler - Stimulus.js**<br/>Stimulus.js is a framework that works with the HTML you already have. It takes an approach of \"just a sprinkle\" of JavaScript much like Alpine as opposed to React/Vue approach of handling the whole lifecycle and state. We'll look at when this approach is helpful, the ecosystem of complementary tools that surround it, how to use it and when not to use it.</p> <p>**Tom Cartwright - changes in Electron**<br/>Electron is framework for making desktop applications using web technologies. Lots of changes have been made to framework over the last few years with aim of improve their security model and these have had significant impact on how developers can and should build applications using Electron. What are these changes? What implications do they have? What are the alternatives to using Electron? All these questions will be answered.</p> <p>\\-\\-\\-<br/>A huge thank you to our venue sponsor SR2 for hosting us and providing refreshments.</p> ",
