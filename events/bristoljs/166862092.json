We are honoured to have a lovely exchange student on loan to us for the evening from Oxford JS.</p> <p>A warm welcome to Ben Foxall. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benjaminbenben\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/benjaminbenben</a> Ben was most recently a speaker at the London JS Conference whereby he wooed us with his wizardry of his Second Screen skills. These techniques are very much in their infancy but will be huuuge over the next few years.</p> <p>You heard it here. First.</p> <p>\"Our interactions with the web are usually through a single browser or device. \u00a0We'll talk about ways to combine devices to create interfaces which aren't possible with traditional web apps.\"</p> <p>Hosted by the lovely Basekit.</p> <p>Doors open at 18.30 for a prompt 19.00 start</p> ",
