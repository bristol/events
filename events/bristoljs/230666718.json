Hopefully there should be something for both beginners and people more experienced with Redux. Let me know if there is anything in particular you would like to see covered.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Tom Spencer - Building a RESTful API with Node.js</b></p> <p>Node.js is well suited for building a RESTful API due to its event driven, non-blocking IO architecture. In this talk we'll briefly introduce the concepts of a RESTful API and then go on to implement a simple CRUD API using express.js.</p> <p>If you wish to follow along with the demo, you will need to install <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/\">node.js v6</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community\">MongoDB v3.2</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.getpostman.com/\">Postman</a>.</p> ",
