It supports iOS, Android, and soon Windows Universal. In this talk, you will learn how to build a native mobile app with just a bit of JavaScript and XML.</p> <p><b>7:45pm:\u00a0</b><b>Lightning Talks</b></p> <p><b>Thinking about testability - Roy Smith</b></p> <p>When writing JS apps we tend to structure our code for elegance, DRY, future-expansion, reusability, and readability. In my experience, bottom of the list of concerns tends to be testability. I'll show two techniques that I use that have proven invaluable in speeding up iterative development as well as facilitating automated tests.</p> <p><b>BristolJS: The Story so Far - Adam Butler</b></p> <p>Adam shares some stats about the group and outlines the plans for growing and expanding over the coming year.</p> <p><b>8pm: Pizza, beer and head to the pub</b></p> <p>Our talk nights are made possible with our sponsors, in particular:</p> <p>\u2022 cxpartners - our generous hosts</p> <p>\u2022 Just EAT - providing the pizza-based sustenance</p> <p>\u2022 Pusher - our newest sponsor!
