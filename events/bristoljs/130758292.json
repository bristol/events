In my talk, I hope to be able to answer that question!</p> <p>I'll start with a quick 101 introduction to the concept and the basic syntax.</p> <p>Then I'll deep dive into a couple of real world uses.</p> <p>I'll talk about something that I've actually used it for - filling in a horrible, non-standards compliant web form that doesn't just accept a POST request with the form filling add-on CasperJS.</p> <p>Then I'll finish up with some examples of a use case that I want to learn more about - Having Phantom run functional tests against a website, using popular testing framework Mocha. Is this a viable alternative to Selenium?</p> <p>Hope plenty of you can turn up!</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> ",
