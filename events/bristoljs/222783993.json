Technology advancements have also played their part with raw technology improvements such as WebSockets, and solutions like Socket.IO, SignalR, Faye, Firebase and Pusher.\u00a0</p> <p>In this talk I'll cover the past, present and future of real-time communication technology, the real-time web and provide a number of use cases and demonstrations of how the technology is actually used today (it's not just chat and spaceship games).</p> <p><b>Visualising Runkeeper Data with the Web</b> \u2013 Ben Foxall</p> <p>I'll take us through some features of the web platform that allow us to retrieve, process, and visualise data.
