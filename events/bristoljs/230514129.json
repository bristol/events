ViziCities not only allows you to explore any city in the world in 3D in your browser, it also lets you overlay data like live transport, crime, pollution, live social data, and weather. Think SimCity meets the real world!</p> <p>In this talk, Robin Hawkes, ViziCities' creator will introduce you to the project and demonstrate its powerful methods for visualising the complex data locked within our cities.</p> <p><b>Contextual Communications: What, Why and How? - Phil Leggetter</b></p> <p>You've probably heard the term \"Contextual Communications\" over the past year. But what does it mean? Why does it matter? And how would you use contextual communications within an application that you are building?</p> <p>In this talk I will share the What, Why and How of contextual communications. Think SMS, in-app messaging, voice and mix in things like location, time, history and all the data around this.</p> <p>Will also bring Ruth some cake! It is her birthday.</p> ",
