    "description": "<p>Web components! Do we need them? Can we use them? Will we ever be able to use them? Is Polymer creating a false utopian vision of these things or are they hastening the adoption of native web component capability into modern browsers? Is Microsoft Edge lack of support for web components a distainful snub or a silly oversight? If Shadow DOM makes me feel a little anxious can something be done to soothe me?</p> <p>I don't have answers to all of these, but I aim to by the 29th July. If you also aim to find answers to these please try and find out slightly less than I do so I don't look like a nob.</p> ",
