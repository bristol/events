This is bringing faster, more efficient and extensible apps, creating a better end-user experience.</p> <p>Expo, which powers most new React Native apps has also had a revamp, resulting in smaller app sizes, and finally allowing you to stay within the tool bundles without ejecting.</p> <p>We'll learn how to bring these changes to your app today, and discover the value these changes can bring to your users and developer experience. There's never been a better time to be using React Native for cross-platform apps.</p> <p>**Surma - Deno.js**<br/>Talk description coming soon</p> <p>\\-\\-\\-<br/>A huge thank you to our venue sponsor SR2 for hosting us and providing refreshments.</p> ",
