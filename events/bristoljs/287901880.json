    "description": "<p>We've got two fantastic talks planned for this month</p> <p>**Chris McKirgan - What's new in React Native**<br/>A lot of changes are happening in React Native; a huge overhaul of the underpinned architecture is coming - and is here. This is bringing faster, more efficient and extensible apps, creating a better end-user experience.</p> <p>Expo, which powers most new React Native apps has also had a revamp, resulting in smaller app sizes, and finally allowing you to stay within the tool bundles without ejecting.</p> <p>We'll learn how to bring these changes to your app today, and discover the value these changes can bring to your users and developer experience. There's never been a better time to be using React Native for cross-platform apps.</p> <p>**Surma - Deno**<br/>To bust the misconception right away: It\u2019s pronounced Dee-No, like the character from The Flintstones.</p> <p>Deno is arguably a most mature of the new JavaScript runtimes. It was conceived by Ryan Dahl, who also created NodeJS, and first announced at JSConf EU 2018. At the time it made waves with its support for TypeScript, having a granular permission model and shipping Web APIs over custom one-off APIs. As a result, you get a runtime where every web developer should feel right at home.</p> <p>In this talk I want to give you a quick overview of what Deno is, where it is going and why Deno Deploy might be of interest to you.</p> <p>\\-\\-\\-<br/>A huge thank you to our venue sponsor SR2 for hosting us and providing refreshments.</p> ",
