We\u2019re just finalising the details and will let you know as soon as the speakers have been confirmed.</p> <p>The event is free to attend, but as space is limited, please RSVP to reserve your spot.</p> <p>**Talk #1 - Lessons for developers from the Horizon Post Office scandal by Tom Cartwright**</p> <p>At the heart of the Post Office scandal is Horizon IT system - a large distributed set of services that provided the backbone to a core piece of the countries\u2019 infrastructure. However the bugs and failures it suffered from formed the basis for evidence used to wrongly accuse or convict thousands of postmasters, devastating lives and livelihoods. This talk demonstrates how and why the Horizon system suffered from these failures and highlights what we as developers can learn from this cautionary tale.</p> <p>**Talk #2 - TBC**</p> <p>Finalising details, more to follow soon</p> <p>**Talk #3 - TBC**</p> <p>Finalising details, more to follow soon</p> <p>**Sponsors**</p> <p>A huge thank you goes to our venue sponsor, award-winning assistive technology company [CareScribe](<a href=\"https://carescribe.io/\" class=\"linkified\">https://carescribe.io/</a>), for hosting us and providing refreshments.</p> <p>**Where?**</p> <p>CareScribe HQ, Temple Studios, Bristol, BS1 6QA ([Google Maps](<a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/zC4gn3npuMhJ5RxD9\" class=\"linkified\">https://maps.app.goo.gl/zC4gn3npuMhJ5RxD9</a>)). Right next to the Temple Meads train station!</p> <p>**About Pixel Pioneers Conference**</p> <p>A quick personal note from me (Adam) organiser of Bristol JS:</p> <p>I've been an attendee of Pixel Pioneers since they started in Bristol and have massively enjoyed the conference, learnt a ton and had a great time getting to know people who organise and attend the events.</p> <p>This is not a paid endorsement, I wanted to pair with Oliver who organises the event because I think it's a great event and want others to be aware of it.</p> <p>Beyond the fantastic talks and workshops, I've liked that they support diversity in the tech community by offering scholarships to underrepresented or marginalised groups in tech. I'm really excited for this years event and hope to see some of the Bristol JS community there too.</p> <p>Pixel Pioneers are offering **Bristol JS members 15% off with the code BristolJS,** follow this link to get your ticket: <a href=\"https://ti.to/pixel-pioneers/bristol-2024/discount/BristolJS\" class=\"linkified\">https://ti.to/pixel-pioneers/bristol-2024/discount/BristolJS</a></p> ",
