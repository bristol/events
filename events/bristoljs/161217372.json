In this talk, we will go about making a basic game from scratch. Along the way, we\u2019ll learn about setting up Clojurescript projects, using the Light Table IDE and how to design a game using immutable data structures. I\u2019ll also explain why Clojurescript is useful for front-end web development.</p> <p>--</p> <p>It is also Katja's birthday, so come prepared!</p> <p>*Passport and E111 is advisable.</p> ",
