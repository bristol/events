This talk will provide an overview of the various methods for building layouts with CSS Grid and demonstrate how it can help us construct complex components. We\u2019ll look at how CSS Variables (custom properties) can bring even more power to our CSS, giving us finer control over our responsive grids, and DRYer and more maintainable code, as well as exploring how these dynamic variables can be changed in CSS and Javascript to afford some exciting possibilities.</p> <p>PLEASE NOTE THE CHANGE OF VENUE!! We are going to be meeting at the offices of Zone Digital, The Brew House, Tower Hill, Bristol BS2 0EQ .
