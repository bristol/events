I\u2019ll cover three different libraries, their use cases, performance characteristics and a bit of the meta \u201cwhy do we animate?\u201d</p> <p>Expect live demos, code samples and plenty of hand-waving explanations!</p> <p>----------------------------------</p> <p>Huge thank you to our sponsors Novate IT, SR2, Travel Local &amp; Immersive labs.</p> <p>Also, our amazing hosts SR2 who will be supplying our space, food and drinks!</p> <p>Video Recording Sponsored by Pusher</p> <p>You can view previous event talks and more by visiting the Pusher App YouTube channel!</p> <p>Pusher is a hosted service with APIs, developer tools and open source libraries that greatly simplify integrating real-time functionality into web and mobile applications.</p> <p>Pusher will automatically scale when required, removing all the pain of setting up and maintaining a secure, real-time infrastructure.</p> <p>Pusher is already trusted to do so by thousands of developers and companies like GitHub, MailChimp, the Financial Times, Buffer and many more.</p> <p>Getting started takes just a few seconds: simply go to pusher.com and create a free account.
