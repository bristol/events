We're continuing to take advantage of our events being remote and asking speakers from outside of Bristol to give talks. This month we're super excited to have Max Stoiber giving a talk.</p> <p>As with last month we're keeping the best bits of what make our events special, our community. Before and after the talk you'll be invited to join a breakout rooms of up to 15 people to have a bit of a social catchup with friends, colleagues and peers.</p> <p>---</p> <p>The past, present and future of CSS-in-JS by Max Stoiber</p> <p>Where did CSS-in-JS come from, where has it gone since those humble beginnings and where will it go in the future?</p> <p>About Max</p> <p>Max is the technical cofounder of Spectrum.chat, the community platform of the future. He also makes styled-components, react-boilerplate, micro-analytics and a bunch of other open source projects and he co-organises the ReactVienna meetup.
