    "description": "<p>We are delighted to be participating in Workshop Wednesdays, alongside Women's Tech Hub, for real life meetings at Desklodge House.</p> <p>It is a slightly later start than a couple of years ago (ie last time we were face to face!) as many people will be travelling from home due to remote working. 6.30 pm is suggested for checking in. There won't be pizzas (this may change if we get some sponsors in), though we will provide drinks and we will also put a break in for people to mingle</p> <p>Format<br/>It will be a drop in for networking, discussion and support, allowing beginners as well as professionals to mix easily. For beginners, the specialists should be able to propose training in the areas of expertise and support where help is needed. We will also be supported by Slack channels.</p> <p>We expect that groups will naturally gather (we'll provide a bit of facilitation!) so that those developing skills in Python, WedDev101, BDSML and possibly gaming etc are close to each other and easily able to chat or ask questions.</p> <p>Other groups will emerge over time, depending on what attendees are looking to learn and develop.</p> <p>We'll leave the zoom meeting available for anyone wanting to touch base with the group.</p> <p>Join Zoom Meeting<br/><a href=\"https://us02web.zoom.us/j/82188350994\" class=\"linkified\">https://us02web.zoom.us/j/82188350994</a></p> <p>Meeting ID:[masked]<br/>Find your local number: <a href=\"https://us02web.zoom.us/u/keuIvOld7X\" class=\"linkified\">https://us02web.zoom.us/u/keuIvOld7X</a></p> ",
