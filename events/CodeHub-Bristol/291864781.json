They are kindly organised by our good friends at [Womens Tech Hub](<a href=\"https://www.wthub.org/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.wthub.org/</a>). All levels are welcome to come along and use the opportunity to study and have a chat with like-minded attendees.</p> <p>**On 8 March, we will be running an SQL workshop. Please sign up [here](<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/codehub-bristol/events/291714736/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/codehub-bristol/events/291714736/</a>) to attend.**</p> <p>Other informal groups tend to emerge depending on the interests of attendees, for example:</p> <p>* **CS50**: for those interested in getting a grounding a Computer Science, CS50 (Harvard) provides an excellent remote course. We provide a space where learners can watch lectures (bring your own headphones!), read notes, attempt and discuss the lab sets or problems, and share experiences with others. (Note: this is *not* a taught course - the emphasis is on self-study and sharing.)<br/>* **WebDev**: an opportunity to work on your own project or course and learn more skills from others.<br/>* **Study Group**: a quiet place to study, code or work away from the more interactive groups.</p> <p>Other groups may also be arranged by Women's Tech Hub who will send out a separate invitation.</p> ",
