    "description": "<p>We're working through the fantastic Haskell Programming from First Principles (<a href=\"http://haskellbook.com\" class=\"linkified\">http://haskellbook.com</a>) book.</p> <p>Each week before the session you should aim to read through the relevant chapters for that week and to attempt all the exercises. The session will be a chance to discuss what has given you trouble, compare solutions with others, re-attempt some of the exercises without notes etc.</p> <p>People who started attending last year can carry on from where we were.</p> <p>There was also a call for a second group last year so people are welcome to come and start from the beginning. There won't be too much separation between the groups but I want to make sure that everyone has a clear weekly target that they should be completing.</p> ",
