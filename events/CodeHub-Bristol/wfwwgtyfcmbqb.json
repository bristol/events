Whether you are an experienced developer or just want to find out a little about coding, you are more than welcome. Popular topics include web-development, data, learning to code and AI, but if you would like to meet with people and learn, then please join us.</p> <p>All you'll need is:</p> <p>* A project you'd like to work on, or a subject you'd like to study<br/>* A laptop (probably!)</p> <p>**What is a \"hack night\"?**<br/>Hack night is a casual social coding event where people can come together to work on projects and learn new technologies in any language at any skill level. It is a good time to work on those projects on the \"back burner\" that you never have time for.</p> <p>Some people will have personal projects that they want to work on in a social atmosphere. Others may be interested in pairing up to work on a project or learn something new together, or work through some online coding challenges. Some people may be experts, others may be just beginning or starting back after a break - all are welcome!</p> <p>***</p> <p>**About CodeHub**<br/>CodeHub also runs workshops and facilitates study groups.
