    "description": "<p>Workshop Wednesdays provide anyone with an interest in programming, data and web development an opportunity to advance their skills and knowledge in person. They are kindly organised by our good friends at [Womens Tech Hub](<a href=\"https://www.wthub.org/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.wthub.org/</a>). All levels are welcome to come along and use the opportunity to study and have a chat with like-minded attendees.</p> <p>We often find that groups get together to share problems or experience, e.g. on data, WebDev or Python (being the most popular), depending on the interests of those attending. It also offers a quiet place to study or code or work away from the more interactive groups.</p> ",
