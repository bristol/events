    "description": "<p>What is a Code Dojo?</p> <p>People who train in martial arts attend dojos, where they practice and try to expand their skills and achieve self-improvement. The idea is that in order to become an expert in anything you need to repeatedly perform *deliberate practice*. Dojos are also places where people of variable experience levels can engage with each other, share knowledge and give support.</p> <p>A Code Dojo tries to take those ideas and apply them in the process of mastering programming languages. Our version of the Dojo was inspired by the London Python Dojo (<a href=\"http://ldnpydojo.org.uk/\" class=\"linkified\">http://ldnpydojo.org.uk/</a>).</p> <p>--</p> <p>This is what a typical session might look like:</p> <p>- Arrive, meet and greet with refreshments</p> <p>- Decide on a topic/\"exercise\" to work on:</p> <p>-- Suggest ideas (anyone can suggest a topic, it could be a game like tic-tac-toe, connect5 etc or an algorithm, or a tweet generator...)</p> <p>-- Vote to decide on 1 exercise to work on</p> <p>- Randomly split into teams of roughly 2-4 people</p> <p>- Each team works together (using Python) to solve the exercise at hand</p> <p>- Each team presents their (complete or incomplete!) solution, talking through their creative process.</p> <p>The spirit of the Dojo will be:</p> <p>- A non-competitive, collaborative, constructive and fun environment</p> <p>*** WELCOMING ALL SKILL LEVELS ***</p> <p>IMPORTANT THINGS:</p> <p>- We will be using Python as our programming language.</p> <p>Even if you don't have much experience and only know some basics you can still participate and improve!</p> <p>- To participate in the Dojo you will need to come to the venue.</p> <p>This is because we will need to run things at specific times and do some presentations at the end, which may make it tricky to incorporate remote attendees.</p> <p>- Please aim to arrive on time.</p> <p>We spend roughly the first 30 minutes making introductions and voting on ideas, so we will form teams and get started on the exercise by 7.00 at the latest.</p> <p>- Having a laptop with you is useful, but not essential!</p> <p>Most attendees will likely bring a laptop to carry out the exercises. However, please don't worry if you can't. We will make sure that at least one member of each team does - it is supposed to be a collaborative exercise after all!</p> ",
