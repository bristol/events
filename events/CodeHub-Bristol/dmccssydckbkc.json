    "description": "<p>These sessions are currently run virtually via Discord:<br/><a href=\"https://discord.gg/emqS7HC\" class=\"linkified\">https://discord.gg/emqS7HC</a></p> <p>The Python Dojo is a mixed group coding session, in a non-competitive, collaborative and fun environment. It is hosted by the Women's Tech Hub and usually occurs at Workshop Wednesday's.</p> <p>What is a Code Dojo?</p> <p>People who train in martial arts attend dojos, where they practice and try to expand their skills and achieve self-improvement. The idea is that in order to become an expert in anything you need to repeatedly perform *deliberate practice*. Dojos are also places where people of variable experience levels can engage with each other, share knowledge and give support.</p> <p>A Code Dojo tries to take those ideas and apply them in the process of mastering programming languages. Our version of the Dojo was inspired by the London Python Dojo (<a href=\"http://ldnpydojo.org.uk/\" class=\"linkified\">http://ldnpydojo.org.uk/</a>).</p> <p>A typical session at the dojo looks like:</p> <p>- Arrive, meet and chat. Attendees suggest topics/exercises to work on</p> <p>- Vote to decide on 1 exercise to work on</p> <p>- Split into teams of roughly 2-4 people</p> <p>- Each team works together (using Python) to solve the exercise at hand</p> <p>- Each team presents their (complete or incomplete!) solution, talking through their creative process</p> <p>Things to note:</p> <p>- We will be using Python as our programming language.</p> <p>Even if you don't have much experience and only know some basics you can still participate and improve. You don't need to have Python installed, as our remote sessions often use online interpreters.</p> <p>- Please aim to arrive on time.</p> <p>We spend roughly the first 20 minutes making introductions and voting on ideas, so we will form teams and get started on the exercise by 6.30 at the latest.</p> <p>All things coding related can be discussed on the Codehub slack workspace: <a href=\"https://codehubbs.slack.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://codehubbs.slack.com</a><br/>(new users should first sign up at <a href=\"http://slack.codehub.org.uk/\" class=\"linkified\">http://slack.codehub.org.uk/</a>)<br/>Previous sessions are listed on the CodeHub wiki: <a href=\"http://wiki.codehub.org.uk/python_dojo\" class=\"linkified\">http://wiki.codehub.org.uk/python_dojo</a></p> ",
