    "description": "<p>The Python Dojo is a mixed group coding session, in a non-competitive, collaborative and fun environment. It is kindly hosted by the Women's Tech Hub Workshop Wednesdays.</p> <p>Previous sessions are listed on the CodeHub wiki: <a href=\"http://wiki.codehub.org.uk/python_dojo\" class=\"linkified\">http://wiki.codehub.org.uk/python_dojo</a></p> <p>All things coding related can be discussed on our slack workspace: <a href=\"https://codehubbs.slack.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://codehubbs.slack.com</a><br/>(new users should first sign up at <a href=\"http://slack.codehub.org.uk/\" class=\"linkified\">http://slack.codehub.org.uk/</a>)</p> <p>What is a Code Dojo?</p> <p>People who train in martial arts attend dojos, where they practice and try to expand their skills and achieve self-improvement. The idea is that in order to become an expert in anything you need to repeatedly perform *deliberate practice*. Dojos are also places where people of variable experience levels can engage with each other, share knowledge and give support.</p> <p>A Code Dojo tries to take those ideas and apply them in the process of mastering programming languages. Our version of the Dojo was inspired by the London Python Dojo (<a href=\"http://ldnpydojo.org.uk/\" class=\"linkified\">http://ldnpydojo.org.uk/</a>).</p> <p>A typical session at the dojo looks like:</p> <p>- Arrive, meet and chat. Attendees suggest topics/exercises to work on</p> <p>- Vote to decide on 1 exercise to work on</p> <p>- Split into teams of roughly 2-4 people</p> <p>- Each team works together (using Python) to solve the exercise at hand</p> <p>- Each team presents their (complete or incomplete!) solution, talking through their creative process</p> <p>Things to note:</p> <p>- We will be using Python as our programming language.</p> <p>Even if you don't have much experience and only know some basics you can still participate and improve.</p> <p>- Please aim to arrive on time.</p> <p>We spend roughly the first 30 minutes making introductions and voting on ideas, so we will form teams and get started on the exercise by 6.30 at the latest.</p> <p>- Having a laptop with you is useful, but not essential!</p> <p>Most attendees will likely bring a laptop (with Python installed) to carry out the exercises. However, please don't worry if you can't. We will make sure that at least one member of each team does - it is supposed to be a collaborative exercise after all!</p> <p>Please un-RSVP if you're unable to attend, to free up space for others who can make it.</p> ",
