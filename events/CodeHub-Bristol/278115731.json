    "description": "<p>Come and relax in our (so far) virtual Unwind caf\u00e9. The idea is to have a place for people in tech to talk and listen to what is going on for them - a bit like the 'Frazzled Caf\u00e9' started by Ruby Wax (<a href=\"https://www.frazzledcafe.org/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.frazzledcafe.org/</a>).</p> <p>A chance to see friendly faces and unwind calmly together, offloading bugs and sharing knowledge of healthy coping strategies, books we are reading and anything else we find worth mentioning. You can also just be there and listen if you want.</p> <p>Please note: We will do a medidation exercise or read out a text at the start and end of the event. If you are not interested in this part, you can join after (around 6.40 pm but please not much later) and leave earlier.</p> <p>Susie, Katja and James are your hosts so far, but we'd be keen to find people we can take turns with to facilitate this meeting.</p> ",
