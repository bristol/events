Thanks to Workshop Wednesdays for hosting (<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Womens-Tech-Hub-Bristol/events/261479040/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/Womens-Tech-Hub-Bristol/events/261479040/</a>).</p> <p>The emphasis of this continuing study group is on studying at your own pace and level, alongside others - there is no need to have attended previous sessions to come along and join in. We share learning materials - or you can bring your own. Some attendees like to work through their own problems or projects, whilst others prefer to compare notes &amp; experience with their peers - whatever works (within reason!). Please feel free to contact me if you'd like more information.</p> <p>All levels and genders are welcome, though the focus is likely to be on those who are less (or no) experienced in python. We would warmly welcome those who have a few python skills already and would be willing to support the groups \u2013 it will be a fun way of helping your own development, as well as being a great addition to your CV!</p> ",
