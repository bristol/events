    "description": "<p>We are delighted to be participating in Workshop Wednesdays, alongside Women's Tech Hub, for real life meetings at Desklodge House.</p> <p>It is a slightly later start than a couple of years ago (ie last time we were face to face!) as many people will be travelling from home due to remote working. 6.30 pm is now the checking-in time. There won't be pizzas (this may change if we get some sponsors in), though we will provide drinks.</p> <p>Format<br/>It will be a drop in for networking, discussion and support, allowing beginners as well as professionals to mix easily. For beginners, the specialists should be able to propose training in the areas of expertise and offer support where help is needed. We will also be supported by Slack channels.</p> <p>There are already a few groups forming. In particular:</p> <p>* Pylab (ie Python for learners): A couple of projects, Team Groove and Team Locker, are being organised as a learning opportunity and are suitable for anyone with interest in Python, at whatever level. We often have 'newbies' joining so feel free to turn up and give it a go!<br/>* Bristol Data Science and Machine Learning: this group is getting together for all interested in discussions on these topics.<br/>* WebDev101: this group is working through this course, <a href=\"https://javascript30.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://javascript30.com/</a>, starting on 23rd March - though it will be possible to join at any stage. It should be interesting, accessible and fun.</p> <p>If you don't naturally fit in with any of the ongoing groups, there is an informal area for peer-supported learning or for sharing experiences and ideas!</p> ",
